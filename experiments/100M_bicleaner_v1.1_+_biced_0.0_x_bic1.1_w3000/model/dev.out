Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu with fla@@ wed will in the peace process .
the deal for the Iranian nuclear programme promoted by Obama has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu announced a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly viewed as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had refused this meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call professor , having shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officers found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after shooting at the university that forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he men@@ tions the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised the Lamb , said he was also a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an absence of health reasons and said that he has some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not guarantee an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs track later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ yl Johnson said .
his car was still running in the entrance .
it was not immediately obvious why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education .
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ time girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing some years ago .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had ended his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there were no signs that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and j@@ oked together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight celebration .
Schmidt Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the investig@@ ator , while the Univers@@ ität@@ sch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back to home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been fixed to reflect that the police now says that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his distress call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated gh@@ eh@@ n and a grip length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be seen on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected theaters in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon states that his response to Russia is reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN Chief reiter@@ ates all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , on the ver@@ ge of the Council meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the crisis in Syria , Ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last 11 national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is too early during the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which no one has also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing Tr@@ ump &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and starting to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey results suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
pumps Ar@@ bit@@ rates have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early stages .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P &apos;s GO@@ P voters would be happy with dump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ ump Temp@@ er as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same counts in the nation &apos;s first electoral state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to be effective in his office , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set their guide hats , republi@@ can voters think Tr@@ ump is real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time four of the ten end of July spent their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is shown that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters view Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathering around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will likely contribute to Tr@@ ump Leadership , while anti @-@ pump support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he got 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his campaign against immigrants from Mexico two months ago , immigration was the turning point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of dump crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the new @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with dump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration is left in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump will seem to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs on new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with experience in government .
and they are also fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ ally upset . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential districts
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Sch@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street a square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular sites a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really few .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the prices arrives like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
inci@@ dentally : Munich is not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double Tor@@ ment@@ aler in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller improved the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - and then it went .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their inau@@ g@@ ural match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion of Olympic games in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ ed hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich in the third attempt .
with his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership Müller received good assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised in front of the play at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speeches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shine .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , among them famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they dar@@ ed to work cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offen@@ sives .
the attacks were led too often by relo@@ cation to Link@@ En@@ en Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck at the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when the Olympic champion , ide@@ ye Brown struck Poland &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the keeper Roberto used his knee ( 35 . ) .
even though the Bav@@ arians re@@ treated her usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle sti@@ ches .
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er he was reli@@ eved .
for example , when he pul@@ ls a shot of ideas about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola ordered a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ vern , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Her@@ o only gave the green light after finishing training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , it &apos;s already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , mil@@ ler put Müller yet on it .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of par@@ sed Bayern fans in their audience @-@ block obviously prov@@ oked the followers of hosts of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke do not only harm the lungs , but also their teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term long @-@ term study .
good news : without ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk is reduced rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and gum inflamm@@ ations , emphasizes DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , the authors emphas@@ ise .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth causes more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ening of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could take over ten years , however , until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained the author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to old age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of el@@ ong@@ ation affected DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study shows the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains from the late Anti@@ quity
for the second time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ological Floor Care .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists have now found five .
from text documents it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
beside the rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery containing some 350 tom@@ bs , which belonged to the church .

EU Commission propos@@ ing new trial in dispute over the TTIP
to strengthen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens believe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström , the European Commissioner responsible for the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced its support .
the TTIP is said to have created the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
for the first time a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
up to now , the parties involved have agreed among themselves to arbit@@ rators , a right to appeal against their sentences did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there could then be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states , for example .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , through which companies can dispute the tax pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act outlined the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was above all critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the legal possibilities of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by the fact that it was meant to be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
it remains unclear when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he always records on the map , telling about his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; the clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift in a great opul@@ ent at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be held in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already appeared and had positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .

the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sub@@ stitutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth ord@@ inal studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs were removed , the stage shows have become a colourful spectacle consisting of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ ko .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .

he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although close to 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly out@@ grown St@@ ev@@ ens turns back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; plate in essence . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s dé@@ but has been eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six given questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance from the media likely and the Labour MPs from close scrut@@ iny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several pages of title in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ cab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the BBC &apos;s correspon@@ dent , Robin Bran@@ t , says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour should make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pensions minister , said that the Party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory boss , over the last decade facing the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament .
the Labour leader who promised another politi@@ c@@ ad says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; skill &quot; and stri@@ fe with re@@ members and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister will represent him , if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson for the shelter in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show theater , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works . but a few years later he acknowledged that he failed .
as it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the alliance with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House and its position among its parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds increase by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound was sky@@ rock@@ eting according to data showing a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to that , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July the result of no bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most accurate estimate of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition corporation for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - re@@ affir@@ ms growth .
Glen@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining industry announced that it had taken $ 2.5 billion by a share selling as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his assessment on &quot; selling &quot; for the company R@@ ating .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports service company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages would end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and the generation of U@@ 17 rot@@ ates .
like Viking Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building : here you are living i@@ dol , whose posters hanging in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is the obligation to pay for scho@@ oling ?
who is it that is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has taken care of anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super market , he c@@ ashed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company washed many , many dollars on the che@@ at account .
and with every doll that looks like he and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you mar@@ vel at the wind@@ screen .
he is said to have been so exploited for more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster picks up Lebanese on potato @-@ d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - namely in the potato @-@ don@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger food owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat stuck together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wered with meat and potatoes sp@@ ins in his shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the idea of the Lebanese has been registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for his customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; metal cash launches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sustainability campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fight Al@@ di@@ - collapse &quot; &quot; &quot;
metal cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA chain from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ a launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Metal@@ lica and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A tra@@ der and supplier jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler is conducting its annual investment strategy day for food , alcohol and equipment .
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of his first markets and will take off all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business , and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base , could cost around 13 million dollars from interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a@@ cash is losing market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s revenue in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ a@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
metal cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Met@@ cash had contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ GA@@ S &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food retailers , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction while printing on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests over $ 150 million to equ@@ alize selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores with fast growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and relo@@ cation programs to El@@ an will grow and hope that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than cri@@ tique of his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Tur@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious confrontation with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualifying play in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , shortly after , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent , R@@ yan Har@@ rison , had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison having shou@@ ted : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat the car , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp s@@ lung a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty concerned about is the fact that according to my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to have broken a thu@@ g of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too stern .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he gets tough , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take Kyr@@ gy@@ z on the important decision that starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; joint decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but it ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy surrounding &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants met in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Serbian officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who had fled from violence set up for an unknown time in a land strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivery police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister announced that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries over the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed hope that the EU states would eventually receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , under@@ lined that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency status , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes according to new laws .
authorities are to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves into it .
about 20 succeeded in arriving , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in a national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is continuing to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against her on the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinions determine which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support among men has decreased dramatically , and S@@ anders can only get back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nation@@ ally say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and vot@@ ability is also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president creates a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters in the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos; supporters say that Bi@@ den is a second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton is ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage indicating it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
much like last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elections is unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in the election of their party .
maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
beer is the best choice among the three candidates for hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leader .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and server are continued as Secretary of State during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of ten who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of her party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent do they see as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters nationwide also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , maintain good leadership notes .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush most effectively cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than to be honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not believe him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in a country @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l is eliminated , and others lose their footh@@ old .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and is sur@@ passing Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is struck with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e , and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are third in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son advances in the surveys - with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also pointed out Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ sides for the ex @-@ neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water .
a dip in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with them .
on the other hand , swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student passed away during a hosp@@ itali@@ zation of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder accus@@ ations were lod@@ ged against five persons .
members of the Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft gri@@ pped Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , announced the police .
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood in order to get advice , said forem@@ an Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide tools and basically set up the welfare of the Brotherhood beyond that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said forem@@ an Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning on his wounds .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly suffered injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the fr@@ ing@@ es of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the har@@ ass@@ ment every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ es &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third grave for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of victi@@ mi@@ zed attacks and the formation of a criminal union .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be accoun@@ table , &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation with the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest rates , and the domestic economy will fall , yields on loans will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
that is why representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal ups , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a view based on historical trends how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be depreci@@ ated 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study on what is happening after F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has been in the past 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate rise , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal status after 500 days , with an average yield in the last six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ dered later in the raising cycle and the return on return is starting to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP had been nominal GDP of 118 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants agreed all year on a net interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading will only have a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all raising cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing swing in GDP and Pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights were put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is quicker than in stocks when they change their strategic direction .
bonds appear to change direction as soon as the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / lowering occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle the bond yields are falling immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting that Jones thinks that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the dollar &apos;s strength and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in large and complete , companies that process the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from this when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have posted an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the net interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts by 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) on average .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains from higher income , even if experts differ in how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s Conserv@@ ative Member critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foolish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handled the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham also said to BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under another name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously called examples where you actually only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on commission , I think is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports under fire to step into the feet of commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handled The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time it started an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to issue fees for other entertainment formats .
net sales in August were slow@@ ing down and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures showed only 7 percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sale index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases in front of this event , held on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , in which buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of £ 5 was issued a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines more than one @-@ third of shopping is now done via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to pay their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning procession went past the holy site , where only days before a building ran through the roof of the mos@@ que and then fell onto the bed .
the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king passed a san@@ ction on the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Square of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ch at the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch goes on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have let the arm of the crane stopped when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Sau@@ press Agency stated that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that foreign travel is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the large mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ch , which later this month , were gathered .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounding Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over larger building projects .
the dec@@ eased Chief of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a retired son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said 15@@ 8 people remained hospit@@ alized .
government representatives proposed that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent wounded .
other criminals will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops that aim at tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q stores nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority today .
because the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to carry out DIY jobs in their houses , according to the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the chain chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that address tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten buying decisions were made by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to move this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and revenues when the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the District Court of K@@ lagen@@ furt , two of the function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants had used funds for private purposes during the years 2006 to 2011 .
at the end of the year , he will be charged with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the defence argued that at no point in time the association was an asset of an asset .
the sports officials only accounted for expenses and the Sport@@ club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money , came out of debt - the Pas@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we carry the club further or do we lock ? , &quot; one of the defend@@ ants said , in the bread @-@ based audi@@ tor of the financial market .
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance policy as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on the acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to make any debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in the event of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the compensation claims has been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , one has paid off a portion of the expense allowance only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore l@@ ump and not detail bus@@ h@@ ings appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and austerity books jointly administered the two defend@@ ants , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judge asked why the pay@@ outs had not been disclosed to the association in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for financial support , important is just the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigation into account of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
that would have been set@@ backs , the accused explained .
this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally meant that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage repar@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never been har@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never paid a cent salary , he only paid Kilomet@@ ers and diets .
he charged the association 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual expenditure had been much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to instruc@@ t precise documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept , according to an operating audit , in which everything had been correctly judged , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter money was also related to the other defend@@ ant .
all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , and he had to go from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the witness of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches another 30,000 jobs
in addition to personnel cuts running for three years , Compu@@ terri@@ ese will disman@@ tle further jobs in split@@ ting the company .
the positions at the US computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning disman@@ tling of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs tot@@ alling 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
the disman@@ tling of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP still employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent after the stock exchange .
the company in Pal@@ o Alto , California , has grown up with printers from California . this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts shall be listed on the stock exchange .
once again disap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer according to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
as a result , revenue fell in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with split@@ ting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted very late that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and get more and more businesses doing the same online .
all in all , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed against several hundred refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water cann@@ ons .
the German Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k with@@ drew the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen , a water designer stood ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first started to use pepper spray .
the police then used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have withdrawn a little while waiting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had breath@@ ed the tear gas shou@@ ted .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of deciding on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday in order to make the important decision whether interest is raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do now , now thinks that F@@ ed will continue to res@@ ign and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero sector and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior assistant at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y view of global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to set itself on an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ectors at the Delta State University aband@@ oned ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I &apos;m sorry about the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he shot at one , and killed one .
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
there was no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb came 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb pur@@ port@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolute best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ a Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ eman took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doctoral title from Delta State University on how his curriculum vit@@ ae on the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
worldwide , around 1,000 executives around the world will charge the workplace .
but there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and utili@@ zes the cheaper eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger &apos;s business .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the executive team headed by chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) is intended to resume negotiations after the court @-@ controlled strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving concept in addition to the pilots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it fores@@ ees that in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is shifting to the Group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the champion league defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside defense to cry and to exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated in the field nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
related to : Manchester United Rec@@ ei@@ ves the L@@ oss of Luke Sha@@ w at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ spiel by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron wrote in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
all beautiful and good , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , instead gives a summary of the 2012 movie version adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so un@@ familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , as the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees for@@ ging , th@@ need@@ ing frustr@@ ating soul , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election bure@@ au .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ on &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
to push Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I wouldn &apos;t finish a reverse win .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown dimension on test level , is an option for the attack .
this is related news : Adam Ly@@ th is reti@@ ring from England &apos;s test @-@ cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ eer are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , although he didn &apos;t have such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer , whom I put up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw early this season in Yor@@ k@@ shire when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player &apos;s vi@@ cious circle .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred of us straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Hab@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
people may view his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ der who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
fellow te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not set the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

a European diplom@@ at , recently , said that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises as the EU is now and not always full of its own guilt , self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they most often do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend looking for an outside UK inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states Berlin - and allows more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials in some capitals to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking forward to his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is hard to imagine that they will pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have similar tendencies .
therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 is supposed to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain won &apos;t gain anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the Oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press scene , as they were not supported during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opportun@@ ist who has made himself a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his ins@@ ati@@ veness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone hack@@ ers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going for his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened up a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems in danger to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I put it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ epr@@ int tendency and the wil@@ der realms of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ out was fighting in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touch @-@ up bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Siege @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all cases , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded that they critici@@ zed the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public expects the statement of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports previously by tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most of the products at most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he , said that the statements of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative risks compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national responsibility .
BBC should give up East@@ ender , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square so@@ aps .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to hold the broadcast fee , which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least put its production to programs that others do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wi@@ dest possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambition of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shipments reflect what former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ ender .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they do their job and they can argue if they go on their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think all , we all think that you get a great deal here for £ 150 per year , but for those who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied in front of the committee on Tuesday , called on the BBC to check , &quot; educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said just little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be an example of &quot; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ating and talking about the public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships Ms El@@ stein said that BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms of which he said that only a handful of tel@@ ev@@ isions are shown , and with the commercial channels to make alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have cultivated worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the stimul@@ i work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultras@@ onic to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted into the worms , where they turn on the changed motors .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light emit@@ ted by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms trade - by creating an Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic delicate corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through blu@@ ei@@ ving with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a progression of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair dates back to the area within Excel where exhibitors anticipate fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into residence halls ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to w@@ add@@ ling : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you took sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you honestly say Mar@@ mite is neither loving nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and commun@@ es meeting places , but they are also places where people attract and put their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship with your university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of pos : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by baking .
since you begin the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked something for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and at the end may associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker .
bad bl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep dor@@ man@@ t when they kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence halls .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say they use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with them more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of pro@@ verb@@ s you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my flight asked her neighbors whether they had something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with more lau@@ dable music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she let her own music anno@@ y her , shut her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be too much embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , get rid of them , dis@@ connect and then see them every day and maybe experience how they all pull together all together ?
of course , the heart walks its own way - but if a hot mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is fun , but it takes only moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
grant by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which will put you in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single persons , t@@ anning agents
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need shelter , but also the single mother and the servant ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build still today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds a holiday house for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here to a large extent here .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story terra@@ ced house is the solution .
mer@@ cen@@ aries : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put the people in blocks of flats .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is reasonable .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have correctly dra@@ gged my project through construction law .
especially complicated it is always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ chen@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ verordnung .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it still under@@ goes who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the space missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely doesn &apos;t work .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
mer@@ cil@@ ess : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees but also the single mother or the servant of the poor .
I show you how to build today still cheap and good .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , since they receive an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made that impro@@ b@@ able by reducing the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install apps once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch off half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer chess club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; which was founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus the membership number increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the First Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein accepted .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent research should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club as well as friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined forces under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office has recently been opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services provided by the health and nursing staff .
for years we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service to ensure that car@@ egi@@ vers are often left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too seldom many services of the insurance companies are not avail@@ ed because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physio@@ therapeu@@ tical treatment can be used .
the offerings of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre in particular in the demographic shift .
for this reason , a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg is indispensable in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10@@ am to noon .

in Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young boy and struck him on his face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose drop and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and talked about the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was taken home by his friends .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and drove past demonstr@@ atively several times .
when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the wounded went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and th@@ igh@@ s were checked with the help of a stick @-@ stick .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
until now , only a vag@@ ue day description is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters in size and was clothed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Adams .
the mayor of Saxony , Bernd Bor@@ mann , is also pleased about this , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ kel Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel prophes@@ ies retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at half a point in the next few months .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the office on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ go@@ l years ago who are currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to get into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ bow@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was so far , I just ph@@ oned her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler had bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Head of Emergency Medicine in Di@@ ep@@ holz and was involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ bow@@ ausen .
the mil@@ ler , both of them inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle as a general practitioner .
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a speaker room more .
in addition , the E@@ DP is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of 50@@ 000 Euros receives the mil@@ ler within the scope of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ inen mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ go@@ l , some 2,000 patients come to the field in the field of rock breaks , while in North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Adams .
if no successor could have found it , it would have gone too .
by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers consultations are still looking at familiar faces : the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power take over the ri@@ ms .
with their farewell , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the medical profession has practiced for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she already felt a little sorrow after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds , laughing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed against gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also going on at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is at the forefront .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue on arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is , however , already strongly controlled as the outskirts of the Schengen area .
as the minister pointed out , Slovenia wants to avoid its borders for refugees but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the c@@ roati@@ an police could pick them up in the nearby maize fields .
since then , according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving at the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days his country is counting on around 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which until now had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would conver@@ ge in Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was possible for people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor will we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day , more buses would be expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates had been on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a shift in the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west @-@ facing route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed earlier that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities of border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you pass strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good certificate to the country , concerning the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side , around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps to the refugees , on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are also still not cleared mine fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have belonged to a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having gained insight into even un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .

they control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels each with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce support awak@@ ened its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted by mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into town and people with the action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Help is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as to questions and discussions as the volunteers .
while some people spontaneously jumped to the chal@@ k and affir@@ med the sentence &quot; my life affir@@ mati@@ vely , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer for long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
there are always little discussions about the action , about life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on site .
&quot; only when I make clear that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant in Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband sponsor of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce .
this is why this public effective action is good for the 20 year old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets is understandable , but it is a very personal matter .
the issue of death and dying is still stuck with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people .
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid tells .
the funeral and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with the topic of personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was looking for volunteers , she reported immediately and was part of the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and their relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in St. Vincent &apos;s hos@@ pi@@ ce .
they are all trained carefully .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations facilitates the training , training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning companions .
every two years , training for new employees is offered .
the pla@@ ques described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
there , too , further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards .

the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expect a total of 10,@@ 84 $ according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set .
the lower prospect comes despite the price increases , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and effective January 4 , and despite higher surcharge for bo@@ d@@ land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it was nonetheless expected that the result would increase vis @-@ à @-@ vis the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues , and because of growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company provides &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday occupation were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts questioned by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six analysts asked analysts expect $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which has generated sales in its Un@@ ity Express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , the increase in sales in the bo@@ d@@ field transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit reported higher revenue because of higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
there is a mur@@ al of the United States with a threatening view at one end of the two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double assignment from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive through the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ ische Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rates , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes itself uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts l@@ essen the impact by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones industrial average jumped 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed policy su@@ stains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they wouldn &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rate increase would re@@ assure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ag@@ gra@@ vation of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , that it would be necessary more economic progress , an increase in the set anticipated .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world drew together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with D@@ ow now nearly 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ in Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the monetary authority of the world .
in recent years , the influence of the central bank has been enormous .
the mere indication of the former leader , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
lacquer , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a rise in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives rever@@ ted these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis like the market sl@@ ump in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination of Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ences don &apos;t come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should advance the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe für Flüchtlinge
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
making a warm welcome does not work without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still very fond of her 74 L@@ enses .
she does it every Thursday at the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s home on D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , the whole of other classes is considered to be at a right school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande supports feeding for healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exception for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried authorised the building application for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ priced sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ out of the Bern@@ ese sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the excav@@ ated construction work was unanim@@ ously lowered without any major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the panel also decided on an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the current development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of the planning is to use the roof space for solar installations : &quot; this enables us to build a wonderful large southern roof , &quot; stated mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again the roof @-@ ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - different from the plan stipul@@ ated - should lie below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan regarding the ti@@ lt does not permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ese com@@ mon@@ place is generally more restric@@ tive when it comes to liber@@ ating jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and road sports sponsor@@ ships .
in the next step , the building permit for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station as well as the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision about this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be held on Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the still existing inside station .
the rooms are available .
employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff were informed of the plans .
the change has caused the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the course of the next two years , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree , both houses will lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , will be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district planned this for 2018 , if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , has made rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will hen@@ ce@@ forth be used as shelter for asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I conclude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the real estate continues , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several reflections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day mental psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ relo@@ cation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has not been a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in the past decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand benches of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lion are required tonight ( 8@@ pm ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .
although the league leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the ba@@ thers in the Bh@@ c moved into a painful set@@ back and got something to do .
hunting accident with two wounded at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police reported .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospital .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the police investig@@ ates .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds who had been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violent crime since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the public prosec@@ utor and the police on Wednesday .
as susp@@ icious , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old aged 20 @-@ year @-@ old also applies on Tuesday evening , who , according to the fact , stood up and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she did not come home on the evening after a visit to the autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman investig@@ ators first stum@@ bled upon the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee allowed the police interro@@ gation to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .
a decision on the closer circumstances of the deed should bring the further investigation .
refugees need shelter : study warns of short@@ com@@ ings
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable residence .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er residential building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising number of refugees .
the study also has considerable short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a public deficit which will increase year by year .
currently , some 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metro@@ politan areas , while Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , author of the study , is compla@@ ining .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities with a not@@ ch in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ willing to stay longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the loud noise on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for housing construction .
thus , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for shel@@ ters of the State Bank ( Kf@@ W ) is already well received in cities and congreg@@ ations .
a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros had already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening , which amounted to EUR 18@@ 4 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have a free time : Croatia and Slovenia lead a corridor
there is practically no transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is nevertheless dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring countries Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the closure of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees are broken up to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border to refugees on the previous day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws which came into force on the same day also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic announced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU @-@ neighbouring Croatia .
according to most media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived by bus as well as taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine scra@@ pers are meant to quickly make a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 challenged people .
just before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
convic@@ ted sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established on the border on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
13 families with small children and two elderly people are among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
but practically no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that had left tens of thousands of people on the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barrier nets were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion .
only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country has also strengthened its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instruction from German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees meet on foot .
mayor continued &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clean@@ up when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of Zel@@ ts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
on Sunday , however , because of the refugee flow in Austria , Germany suddenly stopped the railway traffic with Austria , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ ased the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first cut the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u , in order to try to cross the border after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany .
but the regional train was set off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , Sunday before a two @-@ bridge race athle@@ tic - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the construction of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has publicly acknowledged the position of the Hungarian government in the area of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to make decent states for protective seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ y quarters
Konrad , with the fu@@ gi@@ tive of refugees , has to do all his work .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ bank@@ ers to set up districts for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos at the first tak@@ eover centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was done without a big fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad meets a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the same year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 shall provide the Länder , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the provincial captains .
they would have assured him of creating qu@@ arti@@ als for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will help clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help us as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , the legislature may not have to comply with a certain amount of the towel rack or size of the overhead obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply for a temporary period of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the ministry of the Interior , was more successful with his experience .
I am an elderly man , whom one does not say without further into the face of the un@@ truth .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear the costs of the republic , as they themselves explained .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , our own search for districts has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better distribution
for the time being no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for placing refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers are currently under no control of these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism of the city chief follows the division of the refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ bor@@ ated the further procedure in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
to continue the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available .
the protective seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ ing , that now also Austria enters into its borders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire which ones .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Centers .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ spec@@ tor opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to hand over this project in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now received an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about opening a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz area that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who themselves have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest gave birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I share most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ tures when looking at a hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag enhances every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this feature also links some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses himself in a strange way , re@@ jects journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presi@@ dency inspir@@ es the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well with it .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ inary fresh@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related over -@@ zig @-@ corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about pumping .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt kind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native of K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , which besides Tr@@ ump also counts the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts there .
while there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , I tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit of a big mouth , says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the investors , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story started in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the USA for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundations of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the movie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the old one , it is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; Die O@@ ma was born born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the retired win@@ emaker sees the Americans dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so upset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension lady Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the don@@ ald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
from the hand of Vice President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the ratings for today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the stand didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators among the five capitals , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to the Sun@@ rise has closed .
in August , Today , Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance ran between 40,000 and 50.000 .
up to now , Sun@@ rise stands at 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enb@@ one from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wid@@ owed father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ e Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Fam@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe invented 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to beat Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets un@@ v@@ eils ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly unknow@@ ingly have who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at whom Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest secret .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows a day before going out of three , you may accidentally have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tight to the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a per@@ mis@@ sive player who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or .
Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both called fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on the ground with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who W@@ oods should vote , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ gle as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conversion at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ br@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ phi@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ ne in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band for his N@@ FL @-@ debut had hoped .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free voters call for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn kl@@ au@@ ration in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 extra teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sunday faction of the Free elec@@ torate ad@@ jour@@ ned until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN security zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave during the former Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ tor chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critici@@ zed that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would need uniform federal standards nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fir@@ mer Wall Street helps Da@@ x on jumps
the German stock market has closed up with profits after an over @-@ long route of direction @-@ less and nervous trading .
only in the afternoon was a festive opening of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward .
M@@ DA@@ X mid @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the index of the euro area decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also booked the trading places in London and Paris .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus .
many stock markets reck@@ on that markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate in the USA and even to the large decline on the fut@@ ures markets .
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and also left deep traces at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies could possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the figures stated in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x peak .
according to a retail@@ er , a positive report by the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend .
accordingly , investors therefore gave little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
in doing so , investments in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were set off than in the same period of the previous year , as the branch association AC@@ EA took part in the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
the paper by car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets were demon@@ ized by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market the return on stock exchange listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately obvious why the used rubber shells , known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ sac@@ i would say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflict since the 10th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the building plot at Em@@ den &apos;s youth centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor to question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts had been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great street , bought already a few months ago and let the building on it be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for a holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , greeted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group that accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the board members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project has been in the discussion for months , which has been around 10 to 12 million Euros .
violent reactions among hor@@ net owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea dog owner and member of the board of the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge ring overlooking all the other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like many other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus@@ ses must come to expect this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well @-@ hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the planning plans were still variable .

Google starts double donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ f . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusual personal approach to the publication of the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled Kab@@ ul with her family , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are looking desper@@ ately for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / , rec@@ alled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the war torn by the war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that wrote an edi@@ tori@@ an on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan and Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c shr@@ ink@@ age - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
in the meantime , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at the age of 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease worsen@@ ed completely and in some cases at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in a@@ 1@@ c level decreased by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight in comparison to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 32.@@ 1 % ) and recorded rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent adi@@ pos@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point in this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have attached their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that is becoming increasingly popular in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be confronted with the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we have to think about how killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good but he used violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow highly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income from hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age reported the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more involved in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in need of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ t in the social media .
YouTube videos show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young people are supposed to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( Hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange fragran@@ ces , which are very appealing for children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially for small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at K@@ ans@@ as University Hospital , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from a straw@@ berry @-@ sc@@ ented disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated her in the Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah cl@@ ung her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n Trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Victoria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities have suspected that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in New York City planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ gs them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the corrupt plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; squ@@ ad@@ rons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in the event of a rear @-@ end collision , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been slightly injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ bar towards the industrial area and was too late to notice that at the round@@ about two previous vehicles had stopped .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ ble and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta who stood before .
in case of damage to the car accidents , damages amoun@@ ting to approximately 10,000 euros were incurred , the police sp@@ li@@ ts .

there are rum@@ ors of disc@@ ord at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Celtic fighting , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man came from Aber@@ deen , which now stands promin@@ ently at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we &apos;ll come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly the same way - but we have to continue .
we really need to really support Celtic because it makes the players better .
to stand together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this season @-@ time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays on what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned my integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted having sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ tar@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the stri@@ ker and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ to@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice has confidence in Dun@@ dee United Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insisted that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admit that the down@@ fall has to end in the field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll get the guys back on track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to win against Hamilton &quot; un@@ beautiful . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es acknow@@ le@@ dges that his team from Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory , bringing them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic in the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team who has won everything in poker games or le@@ agues where games of this kind won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 for the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the rate of employment for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure higher than the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken bo@@ thered the drain
as the security staff was unable to paci@@ fy the situation , the employees called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials were able to take the stur@@ geon in custody .

why I become a witness to an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed through the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go into details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from that perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who will be able to turn to this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man after wet police chase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persu@@ ades to come from the c@@ anning river &quot; &quot; &quot;
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he over@@ sp@@ ed the man from the c@@ anning river .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water just a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed on Tuesday for a breach incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ h@@ ev@@ ec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Championship soccer player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threatening to finish the race
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Racing Victoria &apos;s ste@@ wards have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cobal@@ t test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go around and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had gone up the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I am going to name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly attach themselves to their n@@ oses because they failed in the attempt to sum@@ mon me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , reign@@ ing President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps make people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment &quot; laugh@@ able , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse writing , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mis@@ er@@ ably put mud on the leg .
it could have been like last night .
it could have been like yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man after driver &apos;s flight was arrested
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycli@@ st and subsequent driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia presented himself to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ hal@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted on account of driver &apos;s flight and lower assistance and other traffic fat@@ alities .
the cycli@@ st , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals due to claims about ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring battles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two guys from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the tac@@ kling of his team and said they were only concentrating on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident as it meant they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s coming up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when she beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focal point , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Benn@@ etts has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and which we view as exciting , especially his young players at speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to big games .
it also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points a little exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man , who may face a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht of Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ saving penalty for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a b@@ ail of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian pass , reports daily with the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving house tears apart &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked at a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left at the last moment , as the police reported .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing jar broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this fell asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ warran@@ ted pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police cared about it and looked at the five images , then analysed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be addiction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search on the computer was done by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the shi@@ vering and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused was computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the charges of having taken in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January of that year , viol@@ ating the requirements and not appearing before the Court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; is to be found in his interro@@ gation .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was given security deposit but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders even before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers were killed by fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn river Inn in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal Inn .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and st@@ ow@@ ls .
there they are welcomed by federal police and for@@ warded to registration .
according to Federal Police reports , more refugees arrived at the Munich Main Station in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 am , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south @-@ west awaited &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of stor@@ ys in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart informed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic in the last days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are especially expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with bows of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday we can see the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is above all a movement among compact cars , which are currently selling well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand : roughly 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Cart@@ el Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade show .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16,@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station , which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what &apos;s going on next to the Astra at the IA@@ A for new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra driver Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
in the trade it comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is completely new in the segment .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bal@@ eno &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe starts in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A .
the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n warehouse on the outside showed above all hands on the front part : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , a series of re@@ visions and new variants are added at the IA@@ A in the compact class , such as the mounted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given law to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel prison , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision that was published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison quarters between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer &apos;s information has been moved to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant against the country of Berlin failed because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions .
however , the judges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case to the re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
court of Appe@@ al decides now on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation were author@@ it@@ ative , a compensation was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a weak@@ ening of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a 2011 decision , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified an in@@ mate in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged daily between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines because of lack of personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore prisoners are trapped again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to fights it should have already occurred because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of offspring , 19 are expected to drop out in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do in Germany ?
according to statements by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , about 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers are expected to come to Germany this year , according to statements by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview shows what is coming to Germany .
according to different forecasts there are between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it was built so far ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
what is dramatic is the lack of housing , but above all in affordable rental objects : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing projects fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply .
therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation , critic@@ ises .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they find employment in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says Mig@@ rations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ u@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there has been a political change according to thr@@ ash@@ hardt : from the employment ban on refugees to recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence requirement that restric@@ ts asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in the society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the point of view is often enforced so that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big barrier to access to the labour market are missing knowledge of German . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ u@@ ck@@ hardt , the Royal Road to Work Integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kinder@@ garten , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only once more important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators is increasing strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for instance by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students with no knowledge of German are prepared in the classroom .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ yer from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no Land asylum seek@@ er or tolerated study - the only exception was Berlin , interior administrator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits after the asylum application law when they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , the latter do not receive a b@@ ill@@ ö@@ g because they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to custody .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ e@@ j , this span shor@@ tens to 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ o@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually introduce the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and further develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state @-@ religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic well @-@ being association who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also include obligations .
thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree to clear contacts and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take advantage of religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stra@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be a major topic for society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , pushing down discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has , as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination body and a general equality law since a decade ago .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U assass@@ ination series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and interest groups do not demand for a long time and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany commit , must become reality over the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , &quot; says Dr Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be integrated into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requires all the newcom@@ ers to hand over healthcare cards at the same time .
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to dispatch so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum application law does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise doctors especially make language barriers possible .
even so far , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more aware of their illnesses than other patients .
not only in hospitals but also in medical practices interpre@@ ting costs need to be taken over , it challenges them .
many refugees , however , would have helped many more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there is clearly more disability , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ related education .
with some of the other symptoms German doctors would come from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans are a highly developed education system , and some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again .
according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attacks and death troubles .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically sick people seeking asylum in the welfare offices can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses in the social offices will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege is inviting you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Promenade invites into the man@@ ege on the brick , was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this banner stands the current stage of maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the family is thus in the blood for the discern@@ ing family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ go cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says managing director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 33@@ ,000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus Festival impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to take up the Cuban duo loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and agi@@ lity - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous Sal@@ mon Sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus are fascinating with flair and agi@@ lity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often a topic for different animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also commented : &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t do well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every mat@@ ing unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , are picked up by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the man@@ ege too .
so the top priority : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals have lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Festival invites to its performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 p.m .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 am and 4@@ pm .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe leads the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with calls .
last month , they had pro@@ str@@ ated him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service business activities .
the expected reduction of jobs leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and diverse portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will focus on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage one has called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the turning of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger emphasized Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer will certainly remain uncertain in the European Championship .
the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases by Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider image for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have noticed most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement will last in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a reasonable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey haven &apos;t travelled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u should start Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal had clear favour@@ ites to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , while on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 were measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by the far @-@ away hope of leading the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in the arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fe@@ ast : comedy Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a depl@@ orable life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery have doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends in order to make a friendship .
in the age of communication led by social media , with their emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if reality domin@@ ates isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the best thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments playing football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even though they often lag behind to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a staff of telephone counsel@@ ing it told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My contribution to people who feel de@@ pressed and at home is clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration on this weekend with the completely re@@ designed cou@@ lis@@ se at the celebration of the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k ?
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast on comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration

di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and S@@ okol@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only aiming to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the club , with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and look back at ease , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris Team , which could hold a 2 : 2 accident on the weekend against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian cas@@ ement was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over to Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the mid@@ field , ht a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far from Kevin Tra@@ pps pen@@ cils in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead PS@@ G itself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill if he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shot which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season goal after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had raised a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent match from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi understood a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league that has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core ga@@ thers $ 2.5 billion by share sales
the Glen@@ core mining giant in Switzerland , which is affected by falling raw material prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday as part of its huge debt settlement plan .
the Glen@@ core business registered in London said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth $ 1.6 billion to pay off its own debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn puts demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of rights to cover has led to a rapid increase at the top of the London Stock Exchange on the early Wednesday morning .
the share jumped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sales as part of the more extensive plans to pay around a third of his $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns about long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodities prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

white House Con@@ fir@@ med Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s Vis@@ it in Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and rep@@ lies President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will be host of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan on this evening after the two leaders have led bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ is visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi also give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on its way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago FC Bayern was just ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner League winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion league champion , twice champion champion , twice champion , the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advises that he was already in Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and that was also the registered cover of the Bayern Munich .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in summer 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he got me up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph in the end .
Matt Dam@@ on brings down variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown dis@@ rupted when he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it with the cast of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian got stuck .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said at first .
the only black person , and she is a groove struck by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that at the end she could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Mr. Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 lifts since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved national action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against col@@ lateral .
in February the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or had already made the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the steps of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task in time with which he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or have earned more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E said ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he has just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt as well if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins turned a chance to climb in one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon stopped his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two intern@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 intern@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ se@@ ater hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the gh@@ ol@@ ts well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks achieved a Bun@@ te , and Simon made his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier a Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in this season in the Major League , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe won a Double Play
after adding an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth inner court , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two intern@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been stri@@ cken before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he was missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;d wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes handed a single to Second Bas@@ eman , Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , ran another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers arrived in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were about three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , who has been on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be defeated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who came in there should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden was sharing on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital were prepared for this case in the past days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily pause there .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse according to the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the government responsible for the first time .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing up@@ side down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international assistance on site for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it was agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement which could include a certain number of refugees from Austria a day after Germany , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their destination is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
on Sunday , Germany had started with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Federation will manage this together with the countries , announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would also mo@@ urn this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view has been strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now manage a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge strength effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to seal the border with Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from searching for alternative routes through Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people that had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , eye witnesses reported thousands of other migrants on the way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ ends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon therefore stag@@ gers easily on its path around the ring plane .
although this motion is only small , but too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the paper &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
thus , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , which sp@@ rou@@ t water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing Munich several weeks
the 1860 München must rel@@ inqu@@ ish the Val@@ det R@@ ama offensive for about a month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old submitted an inquiry to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama was compla@@ ining about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non @-@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility of proving his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his bra@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie could return to the team training again next week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian national player is supposed to start running on Thursday already on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at his head .

man@@ gos are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line@@ age are often dis@@ cour@@ aged .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits also supports the vision , the immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone does not tell us how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet dishes .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first blow @-@ out tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night for Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings strong rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western current .
on the night of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn winds its way up to the adjacent centre and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , there is a stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to accumulate at the alpine slope .
here , rain sets in , which stops until Thursday evening .
in sum , over the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be accounted for in the south of the Alps , which has already fallen into large amounts of ra@@ inf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the blow dri@@ es out , as a result a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east goes over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind is blowing heavily up to stor@@ my weather , and temperatures are clearly declining .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south on the weekend it gets sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday in the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time , he found the city as a perfect sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions should have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome , according to historians .
with his theses on aband@@ on@@ ment Luther , Luther then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church .
hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible text .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now has been published with splendid pictures .
at the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt worked for about three years in his bi@@ ble project for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , which expresses his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here education has already been done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to carry me back with the Lord Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to give the art more value in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today dominated by advertising , and it is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is sup@@ planted .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt asks the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images , let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ alto @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ alto @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art to be : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his pictures . &quot;
I don &apos;t care to fully grasp the Bible , but selected the mysterious themes that are important to him .
&quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler as well as the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failure in politics and administration caused a lot of hard@@ ship , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will go down in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work on the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga set a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its assistance in dealing with the problems arising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach ( DF@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ost@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
soccer can and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professionals put a clear sign when they will wear the stamp &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy is all about , nobody can look away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can make football allies , no , we must use our beam strength , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director , Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on this Friday the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large common work in German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 licens@@ ors had started their own projects in their respective locations is great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already cried out all the time for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief of the Board of Management is losing an eye in the event of an accident
the head of the head of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , then tow@@ ed out to the street - he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ substitute pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except combat ...

review of Public International Law as Part of Federal Law ( Bv@@ M )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group match of the Europa League have definitely sm@@ ashed .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its trunk pi@@ ps on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of home keeper Roman vou@@ ac .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ceful statement by fellow player R@@ eus that the final cover for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl considers it understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the federal government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in the change of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke to Frankfurt on Wednesday at the Frankfurt Motor Show from a &quot; New Mobility Age . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy response to digital radio communication .
a test track is currently being built on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks can be imposed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany plans to use internationally in order to raise the maximum permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles from 10 to 130 kilometres .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees the human being as a driver .
when automated driving increasingly takes over the car , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans still look skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , and 32 percent do not believe that 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents account for 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the USA .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic flowing in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in a traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to take the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point in time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term partnership in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Individu@@ al @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing and we became Europe champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ ranking fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , in the meantime it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the designer changed his initial reluct@@ ant attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely opa@@ que work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed overall art work for which much effort has been done : to indulge in d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list has been hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have incar@@ n@@ ated 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special highlight : a leather h@@ osen outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ otte &apos;s old Ted@@ dy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is also to be seen in the exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he wore his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he did not have to pay the models for his first show of fashion .
they got nothing but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
it used to be on the long Em@@ broi@@ dery in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in great quantities for customers , which they worked for , for example , for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Sw@@ ab@@ ia P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion has played a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , and was then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls several examples : tip in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is borrow@@ ed from past styles , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
mo@@ dest@@ al P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker@@ eien , together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been cut .
there are almost no private shops and wholesale shops .
our products barely reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass production is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports weak@@ en , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to score with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outer branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine locks small glob@@ ules at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took some inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and Sur@@ ro@@ undings and who would like to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie but a kind of continuation , which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical baby girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was t@@ asked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border control policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested after and after and improved by test programs .
the initiative is important because it has a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a legally national business environment and making the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the scope of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting prime minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as announced in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to provide consumers with a significantly higher dose of ven@@ om .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve det@@ ox for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury , that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the catches cannot be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low poll@@ uted that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ els is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous de@@ fle@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal for humans , which is heavily enriched in predat@@ ory fish through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government therefore cau@@ tions that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system particularly in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations invite more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of the total emit@@ ted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanently and extensively exceeded , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had been quoted from the paper in March .
last year , European warnings on mercury in fish were among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
