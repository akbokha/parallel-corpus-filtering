Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also a question of the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu with a lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal signed by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu announced a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly viewed as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had been rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
inside the house the officers found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular historian , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said Lamb had made the fatal distress call at some point later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after shooting at the university that forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he men@@ tions the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he was also a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an absence of health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not guarantee an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ itäts @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs lane later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ yl Johnson said .
his car was still running in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with some 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he received his doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing some years ago .
he was the woman of the women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the congregation participated in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight celebration .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the investig@@ ator , while the Univers@@ ität@@ sch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his distress call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that they have ever married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated aw@@ ning and a grip length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be seen on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon states that its response to Russia is reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN Chief reiter@@ ates all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the crisis in Syria , Ban challenged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last 11 national surveys conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is too early during the election period .
none claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which has also gained a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing Tr@@ ump &apos;s stamina and starting to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey results suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ ump Any popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early stages .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P &apos;s GO@@ P voters would be happy with dump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans does not see Tr@@ ump Temp@@ er as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same figure applies in the nation &apos;s first electoral state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they put up their guide @-@ hats , republi@@ can voters think Tr@@ ump is real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time four of ten at the end of July spent their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is shown that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters view Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to sy@@ ll@@ s@@ words leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he got 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters supporting Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was the turning point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic mode of expression of the dump will hold decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans out of the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration is left in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump will do it too .
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs on new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with experience in government .
and they are also fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ ally upset . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential areas
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Hob@@ oo@@ k@@ weg - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really few .
but in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double Tor@@ ment@@ ee in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller from FC Bayern paved the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic games in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es Hit ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the fin@@ als on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich in the third attempt .
with his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership Müller received good assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a stroll of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speeches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavarian , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , however , with their offen@@ sives , often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work .
the attacks were led too often by reloc@@ ating to Link@@ age Douglas Costa , who rarely passed through to the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one were Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when the Olympic champion , ide@@ ye Brown beat Poland &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the keeper Roberto used his knee ( 35 . ) .
while the Bav@@ arians dressed her usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle sti@@ ches .
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was a decree .
for example , when he pul@@ ls a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola ordered a four @-@ day supply chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ vern , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Her@@ o only gave the green light after finishing training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee manager Matthias Sam@@ mer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , Müller sat on it by penalty of penalty .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ kow in the stadium .
after a smaller group of Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block obviously prov@@ oked the trailer of the hosts of host Pir@@ äus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with drum@@ sticks against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
good news : in the event of a ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk is reduced rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , accentu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , the authors emphas@@ ise .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth causes more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ening of gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could take over ten years , however , until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , the author Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health till high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of el@@ ong@@ ation affected DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains from the late antique period .
for the repeated time archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ological Floor Care .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , arch@@ e@@ ologists have now found five .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with some 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
when a young woman is unhappy at the railway station in de@@ bau@@ ch@@ ery , the Federal Police asks the population for help .
in the early wed@@ n@@ esday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ h the woman took the track from the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
by recording the train , she has borne severe injuries , according to the Federal Police .
it was carried out on the spot by emergency medical personnel and brought to hospital by rescue forces .
on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there is no evidence of the educ@@ ating officers .
the incident might have been witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Bri@@ ck@@ bridge , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) are in question .
information about the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over the TTIP
to strengthen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens believe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström , Commissioner of the European Union , at the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
the TTIP is said to have created the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als specifically fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
for the first time a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
up to now , the parties involved agree among themselves to refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their sentences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there could then be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states , for example .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , through which companies can dispute the tax pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act outlined the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was above all critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ eld ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that the Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association in business Europe warned against limiting the economic potential of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by the fact that it was meant to be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
on Wednesday , it remains unclear when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the shy acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he re@@ counts on the basis of different places he always records on the map , telling about his min@@ utely and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that harmon@@ ise very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can be dri@@ fted into a great opul@@ ent at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be held in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already appeared and had positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ men@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a nationwide celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ flowing with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively on electronic sub@@ stitutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth proper studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows have become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ ko .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a band of five .
in the dark held Hamburger L@@ earn more !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly out@@ grown St@@ ev@@ ens turns back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; plate in essence . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at Prime Minister &apos;s cargo
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut has been eag@@ erly anticipated in the prime minister &apos;s question
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works and for the first time set up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up to take the first of his six pre @-@ set questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several song @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour should make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ labour and pensions minister said that the Party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been Chief of T@@ ory , over the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament over the past decade .
the Labour leader who promised another politi@@ cian says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he is subjected to both &quot; skill &quot; and stri@@ fe with re@@ tain@@ ers and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the House spokesman , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings , but a few years later he admitted he failed .
as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the alliance with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House and its position among its parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

£ increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound was sky@@ rock@@ eting according to data showing a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to that , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid for bid .
between May and July the result of no bonuses in the UK rose by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most accurate estimate of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - re@@ affir@@ ms growth .
Glen@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took $ 2.5 billion by a share selling as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper corporation Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his assessment on &quot; selling &quot; for the company R@@ ating .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports complaint company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages would end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber : Bi@@ eber @-@ expedition in Berlin
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
Ni@@ pp@@ ische 21 years young , a hand@@ ker@@ chief with a p@@ inch of rocks .
the type with the plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros difficult .
more likely even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and the generation of U@@ 17 rot@@ ates .
like Vik@@ toria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building : here you are living i@@ dol , whose posters hangs in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suite , where the Canadian singer res@@ ides , costs exactly as much the day as their mom@@ my E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Vik@@ toria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory school attendance ?
who are they it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has taken care of anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super market , he c@@ ashed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company fl@@ ushing many , many dollars to the che@@ at account .
and with every doll that looks like he and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you mar@@ vel at the wind@@ screen .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that , after all , Bi@@ eber is just in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster picks up Lebanese on potato @-@ d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - namely in the potato @-@ don@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger food owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat stuck together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer is spinning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
in the meantime , the idea has allowed the Lebanese to be registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility models .
Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thinks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well among its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Continu@@ ity Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - Single
metal cash attempts to protect the I@@ GA chain from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Metal@@ lica and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ zin will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler is conducting its annual investment strategy day for food , alcohol and equipment .
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of his first markets , and will take sales of all the available players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business , and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base , could cost around $ 13 million from interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a@@ cash is losing market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s revenue in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Met@@ cash had contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ GA@@ S &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction while printing on revenues and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , is resist@@ ing and investing more than $ 150 million to equ@@ alize selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores with fast growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and relo@@ cation programs to El@@ an will grow and hope that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Tur@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious confrontation with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualifying play in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent , R@@ yan Har@@ rison , had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison having shou@@ ted : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to s@@ cour@@ ge Kyr@@ gy@@ z and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp secured a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty much concerned about is the fact that according to my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to have broken a thu@@ g out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe he was treated a little too stern .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take Kyr@@ gy@@ z on the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; joint decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but it ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversy &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick made a very quick ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary explains the state of emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Serbian officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence got stuck in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries for an unknown time and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the B@@ order ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian ri@@ ot police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries over the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ year bloc at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels unable to agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed hope that the EU states would eventually receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities greater powers to manage the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to under@@ lined that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos converted the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves into it .
about 20 succeeded in arriving , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is continuing to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against her on the ground .
Clinton now has support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced that he is running for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say their opinions determine which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton is ahead of women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support among men has decreased dramatically , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries nation@@ ally say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one fourth would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and vot@@ abl@@ eness is also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the Vice @-@ President raises a potential for the Pres@@ idential Board in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters in the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den is the second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton is ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters consider Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
much like last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries emerged as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important traits in elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
it is best to cut Bi@@ den from hon@@ esty on the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leader .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and server are continued as Secretary of State during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the pres@@ election are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of ten saying that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of her party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent do they see as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of those entitled to vote do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters nationwide sees Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good guidance .
among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush most effectively cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than to be honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not have any opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l is eliminated , and others lose firm footh@@ old .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers across the country . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and over@@ comes Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is struck with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also clearly showed junk from Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side parties for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday , during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water .
a dip in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with it .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
nearly two years after a student died during a chic ritual at a student joint in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder accus@@ ations were lod@@ ged against five persons .
members of the Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft gri@@ pped Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , announced the police .
officials said he was charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said forem@@ an Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began hiding utensils and basically represented the welfare of the bro@@ therhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said forem@@ an Wagner .
he could not be resur@@ rec@@ ted , and he died the next morning on his wounds .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly suffered injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the fr@@ at@@ ernity har@@ ass@@ ment . at least one student died in the har@@ ass@@ ment every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ es &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third grave for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ment and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned this - officially or un@@ officially , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest rates and the domestic economy will fall , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first increase in interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the fuss was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal al@@ ti@@ tudes , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock many seem to be afraid of .
however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things volatile for a while .
once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be depreci@@ ated from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ dered later in the increase cycle and the return on return will begin to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such fragile economic background could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants enjoyed the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading holds only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 up to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing swing in GDP and Pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights provided very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volatile because the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates and the pattern is quite similar as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is quicker than stocks when they change their strategic direction .
bonds appear to change direction once the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / lowering occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields are falling immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting that Jones thinks that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , lending has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and complete companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have posted an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts by 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) on average .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains from higher yields , even if experts differ in how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also tou@@ red the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham also said BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to di@@ gest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also tou@@ red the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under another name .
so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously called examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on commission , I really consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports under fire to step onto the feet of commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced &quot; in a special BBC manner . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wished that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time it started an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to issue fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet turnover has slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday will be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed expenses
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there is now evidence that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures showed only 7 percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sale index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will last their purchases in front of this event , held on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers reduced their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe Black Friday , in which buyers are fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of 5 £ expendi@@ tures a little more than £ 1 was issued online .
with some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines more than one @-@ third of shopping is now done via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the Fashion Cha@@ ins in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the people who were killed in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the distance in order to pay their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning procession was passing by the holy site , where only days before , a building ran through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then fell onto the bed .
the bodies were released for burial as the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 injured , imposed a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Square of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have let the arm of the crane stopped when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Sau@@ press Agency stated that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the down@@ fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the large mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch that later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over larger building projects .
the dec@@ eased Chief of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a retired son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said 15@@ 8 people remained hospit@@ alized .
government representatives indicated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injury .
other criminals will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has led to a rise
this leads to 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops aimed at tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls you apparently belong to a minority .
because Br@@ its employ increasingly craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their houses , according to the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the chain of construction markets , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that address tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten buying decisions are made by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ated .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to move this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I / D@@ ob &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; function@@ aries for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the District Court of K@@ lagen@@ furt , two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the public prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants had used funds for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 from club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions .
it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial mel@@ anch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the defence argued that at no point in time the association was an asset to the society .
the sports officials had only compensated for the expense and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money , amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we pass the club further or halt it ? , &quot; one of the defend@@ ants said , in the bread profession of the financial advis@@ er .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance policy as security on the bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on the acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to make any debts .
in addition , in the event of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the remun@@ eration agreements has been concluded retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore l@@ ump @-@ formwork and not detail bus@@ h@@ ings appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and austerity books jointly administered the two defend@@ ants , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judge asked why the pay@@ outs had not been disclosed to the association in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for financial support , it was important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against the one official investigation into account of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
that had been set@@ backs , the accused explained .
this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted Justice and prosec@@ utor to know .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never been har@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never paid a cent wage , he merely calculated o@@ dom@@ eter money and diets .
he charged the association 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to instruc@@ t accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept , according to an operating audit , in which everything had been correctly judged , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter money was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , and from his place of residence he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the witness of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches another 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts running for three years , the computer giant will build further jobs in split@@ ting the company .
there is no end to the positions at the US computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US @-@ based technology group is planning disman@@ tling 25.000 to 30,000 spots in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs tot@@ alling 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
the disman@@ tling of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP still employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent after the stock exchange .
the Pal@@ o Alto company , which has become a major hub for printers in California , currently sp@@ li@@ ts itself on : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led into a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a again disap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
as a result , revenue fell in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds by split@@ ting up and massive sub@@ missions to changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and have more and more businesses doing the same online .
all in all , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , largely reject rejection : 54 percent , on the other hand , said that 35 percent were appro@@ ving .
61 percent are positive that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
in contrast , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a cooperation with Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , 20 percent of them would be .
29 percent could not decide .

&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility links &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
the organizers of the V@@ DA car association count as two years ago with about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : the Imp@@ act of Viol@@ ence on Serbian @-@ Hungarian B@@ order
the Hungarian police deployed against several hundred refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights .
the German @-@ speaking correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k with@@ drew the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind them a police line had formed and behind the police there was a water th@@ row@@ er ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first continued to use pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have withdrawn a little bit now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas shou@@ ted .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police have also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of deciding on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half that the F@@ ed will do now , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed has paid interest to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero sector and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ inous outlook on global affairs .
it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
die Todes@@ bes@@ e der Delta State University aband@@ oned ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he had shot at a man , and killed one .
lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb came 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ itäts @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb rep@@ ut@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolute best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ man Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a polic@@ eman brought him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a PhD degree from Delta State University on how his course of life is on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save a half billion euros per year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the 1000 senior executives around the world will cost the workplace .
but there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and utili@@ zes the fine @-@ priced row of Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger &apos;s business .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the executive team headed by chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the new order , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
to date , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on Thursday after the stop @-@ by strike on this Thursday .
this divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it fores@@ ees that the Lufthansa transfers to the Group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat in Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside defense to cry and to exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will take and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
related to : Manchester United Rec@@ ei@@ ves the L@@ oss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ spiel by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take too long before you know it by heart .
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
when asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead gives a summary of the 2012 movie version adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; amidst the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this were not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so un@@ familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ f@@ elling , th@@ need frustr@@ ating Once @-@ ler , a ho@@ ck@@ ly , mou@@ th@@ less creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times a year in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral centre .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
to push to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der , whom England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series failure is not on my card .
I would not close a down@@ tro@@ phy .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
related News : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I told this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out more Yor@@ k@@ shire news , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I put up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw early this season in Yor@@ k@@ shire when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must at least have the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and that left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player &apos;s vi@@ cious circle .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred of us straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes into the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him , he was very impressed by me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there are no big number of backup spi@@ der who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white sphere stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment to the set @-@ up .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the changing cab can bring fresh breeze , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before .

the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = getting out of Britain out of the EU ) could gain access if the economy becomes a slu@@ gg@@ ish by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n as leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreign nationals also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , recently said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend looking for an outside UK inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and allows more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials in some capitals to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened with the over@@ stated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking forward to his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is hard to imagine that they will pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have similar tendencies .
so maybe some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 is supposed to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as they were not supported during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z Euro opportun@@ ist , who has made himself a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone hack@@ ers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened up a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks &apos; boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it gently - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ epr@@ int tendency and the willing vessels of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs strug@@ gled in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet @-@ mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties according to all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ ative bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV 24 / 7 and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe , which allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite level economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities on Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all cases , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) have endor@@ sed Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month gra@@ bbed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they said that the public expects the statement of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis model ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports previously by tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most of the products at most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that the statements of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people annually die from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by providing clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national responsibility .
BBC should give up East@@ side , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square Zu@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC six years in his time at Channel 4 without any success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least give its production to programs that others do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wi@@ dest possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ erin is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows show what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ day@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ ender .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche applications should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go on their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast charge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think all , we all think that you get a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for those who are for £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied in front of the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said just little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be an example of &quot; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ating and talking about the public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of part@@ n@@ ering El@@ stein said that BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms of which he said that only a handful of tel@@ ev@@ isions are shown , and with the commercial channels to make alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the instant they are be@@ amed with sound pulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultras@@ on@@ ically to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmit them into the worms , where they turn on the altered mo@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with light impulses .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light emit@@ ted by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms trade - through a blank sheet of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through blu@@ ei@@ ving with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is an intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair dates back to the area within Excel where exhibitors show fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student resi@@ dences extends from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to w@@ add@@ ling : people tell wh@@ ence you get , whether and where you took sab@@ bat@@ ana , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ mite should not love or hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers .
let people .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and community meeting places , but they are also places where people dress up and rebu@@ ke their under@@ wear .
related to : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship with your university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I can receive the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
talking of pos : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked something for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and at the end may associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep dor@@ man@@ t when they kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student dwell@@ ings .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say they use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with them more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of pro@@ verb@@ s you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my flight asked her neighbors whether they had something to make Drum &amp; Bass much qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with more lau@@ dable music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she stopped their own music , shut off her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would come into the same residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be too much embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , get rid of them , separate themselves and then see them every day and maybe experience how they all pull together all together ?
of course , the heart walks its own way - but if a hot co@@ habit@@ ant is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left its keys in its un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is fun , but it takes only moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
grant by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water that you put into the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds up town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the middle Fran@@ con@@ ian corner @-@ valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need shelter , but also the single mother and the servant ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build still cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds a holiday housing project for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ ler , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great deal here .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story terra@@ ced house is the solution .
mer@@ cen@@ aries : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different if you put the people in blocks of flats .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each of the four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .

have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : I have correctly dra@@ fted my project .
especially complicated it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ chen@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ ordin@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ stated , who creates three flats in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the space missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely doesn &apos;t work .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the single mother or the servant of the poor .
I &apos;ll show you how to build even today very cheap and good .
this is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made that impro@@ b@@ able by boo@@ sting the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install apps once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch off half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows one thing : &quot; full attack &quot; against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup 2nd stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ world champion in front of the night race in Singapore on this Sunday of title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the previous twelve races so far and also takes the flood light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer chess club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus the membership number rose to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who has stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein accepted .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent research should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club as well as friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined forces under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation runs down from the hill into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office has recently been opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services provided by the health and nursing staff .
for years we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service to ensure that car@@ egi@@ vers are often left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too seldom many services of the insurance companies are not taken into account , as the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the public hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or a physio@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offerings of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre in particular in demographic change .
for this reason , a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg is indispensable in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office dedic@@ ates itself to the association in the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by doing so , the social foundation makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and on Satur@@ days from 10@@ am to noon .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young boy and struck him on his face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose drop and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and talked about the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was taken home by his friends .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and went over there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a stick @-@ stick , one beat on the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured person had to be taken to hospital for medical treatment .
until now , only a vag@@ ue day description is available .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10,000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Adams .
joint mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ kel Kab@@ bert are also very happy about this .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Ellen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is at half a point in the next few months .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the office on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ go@@ l years ago who are currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to get into practice during the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Sty@@ ri@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was ready , I called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eh@@ ep@@ aar Müller &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liked the idea of running its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medicine studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a leading emergency doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz region and was involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
the mil@@ ler , both of them inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ bearing EC@@ Gs and need a speaker room more .
in addition , the E@@ DP is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a subsi@@ dy of 50@@ 000 Euros as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t &apos;s mayor , Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ go@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the field of rock breaks in every quarter , while in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Kn@@ auf@@ ausen .
if no successor could have found it , it would have gone too .
by the way , anyone who visits Müll@@ ers Spo@@ kes@@ wise also looks above all in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their farewell , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the medical profession has practiced for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Rock stands reminis@@ c@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time she already felt a little sorrow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intern@@ ist says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds , laughing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are leaving refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls will also be ramp@@ ed up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is at the forefront .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it takes clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is what the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is , on the other hand , already strongly controlled as the outskirts of the Schengen area .
as the minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ian wants to avoid its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid the registration .
the c@@ roati@@ an police could pick them up in the nearby maize fields .
since then , according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving at the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days his country is counting on around 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which until now had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was possible for people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor will we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day , more buses would be expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates had been on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary joined us , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further western route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic earlier stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then the EU partners have consistently presented a good report concerning the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side , around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
aid workers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps to the refugees , on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian War .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into town and people with the action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

again and again small discussions on the action take place , about life , dealing with death .

F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery beh@@ em@@ oth lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its land transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect comes despite the price increases that amount to 4.@@ 9 per cent on average and effective January 4 , despite higher surcharge for land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it was nonetheless expected that the result would increase vis @-@ à @-@ vis the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues and because of growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company provides &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday occupation were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts questioned by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
analysts asked analysts expect $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which has generated sales in its Un@@ ity Express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the land transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit reported higher revenue because of higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 percent , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is in danger of facing them at one end of the two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should place the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping the maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive through the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is growing solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes itself uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts l@@ essen the impact by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average jumped 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they wouldn &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rate increase would ease financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed well to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ag@@ gra@@ vation of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , it would be necessary to increase the sentence in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets all over the world picked up at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with D@@ ow now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ in Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be considered technical in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
in recent years , the influence of the central bank has been enormous .
the mere reference of the then leader , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
lacquer , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a rise in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives rever@@ ted these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis like the market sl@@ ump in 2008 , said S &amp; D MEP Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ences don &apos;t come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe für Flüchtlinge
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome does not work without the commitment of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still teaching her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons .
she does it every Thursday at the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s home on D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , the whole of other classes is better than at a proper school .
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande supports feeding for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ese approved the building application for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ priced sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ longed gym@@ n@@ astic construction on the Bern@@ ese sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the excav@@ ated construction work was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before , the panel also decided on an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the current development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be set up with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this enables us to build a wonderful large southern roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof @-@ ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - different from the plan stipul@@ ated - should lie below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reduces the volume of the hall considerably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the a@@ version does not permit any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ese Municip@@ ality is generally more restric@@ tive when it comes to liber@@ ating jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ese .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and road sports sponsor@@ ships .
in the next step , the building permit for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station as well as the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision about this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the still existing inside station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change has caused the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the management and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au on October 1st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , when the Supervisory Board agrees to agree , both houses will lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , will be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will be used as housing for asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I conclude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day @-@ psychology iat@@ rist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has not been a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in the past decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ lions is required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the league leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener ob@@ serves a painful set@@ back at the Bh@@ c and got something to do there .
hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the ab@@ bey on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police were sharing .
after firing a gun , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospital .
it was unclear how exactly the accident could happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of crimes of violence
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old who had been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violent crime since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening also considered susp@@ icious , who , according to the fact , stood up and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she did not come home as agreed on the eve of a visit to the autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , investig@@ ators first met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought to the port fun@@ nel Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .
conclusions about the immediate circumstances of the act are to investigate further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of lack of housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable residence .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er residential building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers in the last year lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also has significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit which is growing year by year .
currently , some 77@@ ,000 residential units have been missing in the metro@@ politan areas , while Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , the author of the study , is compla@@ ining .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities with a need for accommodation in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ intentionally longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should boost social housing construction .
thus , the property tax would be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for shel@@ ters of the State Bank ( Kf@@ W ) is already well received in cities and congreg@@ ations .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros had already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have a free time : Croatia and Slovenia lead a corridor
there is practically no transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is nevertheless dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Minister of Home Affairs , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen Area .
Croatia is still not a Schengen country .
after the closure of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees are broken up to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had set off its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day , moreover , do practically superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic announced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU @-@ neighbouring Croatia .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly make a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , hardly any more refugees come after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 challenged people .
just before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
condemned to prison sentences of up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established on the border on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
but practically no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
barrier nets were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion .
only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country has also strengthened its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instruction from German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , small groups of refugees met regularly .
mayor continued &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance to the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
on Sunday , however , because of the refugee flow in Austria , Germany suddenly stopped the railway traffic with Austria , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ ased the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the near Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first roasted the unexpected guests with a snack and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train towards Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in order to try to cross the border after the short announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped .
but the regional train was set off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein near the inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , Sunday before a two @-@ bridge race athle@@ tic - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the construction of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has publicly acknowledged the position of the Hungarian government in the area of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the border areas with chaotic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to produce decent conditions for protective seekers in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter solid quarters
Konrad used to do all his hands with the fu@@ gi@@ tives .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ bank@@ ers to set up districts for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos at the first tak@@ eover centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday is also done without a big fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
Con@@ rad expects a total of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the year to come .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 should provide the Länder , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the provincial govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him to also provide quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty during the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for housing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it cannot be that district owners have to comply with a certain amount of the towel rack or size of the overhead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply for a temporary period of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , in contrast to the ministry of the Interior , was more successful .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one cannot say without further into the face of un@@ truths .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear the costs of the republic , as they themselves explained .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , our own quest for quot@@ as has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the placing of refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers are currently under no control of these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism is the chief executive of the division of refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone call with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ bor@@ ated the further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will be no longer available .
however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also adop@@ ts controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later on which to acquire .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already le@@ ased , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened a second shop in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to hand over this project in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now gained new growth in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la .
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about opening a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz area that sell this stamp , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who itself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest puts her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I share most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ tures when looking at a hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag enhances every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also join the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign language , re@@ members journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presi@@ dency inspir@@ es the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ inary Fres@@ h@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a concept for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related over -@@ zig @-@ corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about pumping .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt kind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native of K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous kids , which besides Tr@@ ump also counts the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts there .
while there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , it also tends to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the en@@ co@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ or .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story started in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the USA for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundations of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s Dog , Roland Paul , declared the start of the movie .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ ari@@ sts , it is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die O@@ ma was born born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American distant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so upset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension lady Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local alpine association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the ratings for Today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the stand didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise scored 39@@ ,000 spectators at the top five capitals , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to the Sun@@ rise has closed .
in August , Today , Today , Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.000 and 50.000 .
up to now in September Sun@@ rise stands at 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ al of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ er Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wid@@ owed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ age star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Fam@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe invented 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline at the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to beat Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who the b@@ achel@@ or wins .
the woman at whom Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest secret .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows per day before going out of three , you may accidentally added an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the fin@@ als on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become per@@ ishable offen@@ ders who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or .
Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it was all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on the ground with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set to him without reservation , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the U.S. - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ br@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a fight as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League @-@ Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ br@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game following a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ br@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Hay@@ ne also publicly supported Tom@@ bin@@ a in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age for his N@@ FL spin .
Hay@@ ne reli@@ ed on the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN security zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave during the wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum seekers are trying to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critici@@ zed that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the state policy should not fall under the table in the city of Groß@@ stadt .
a long @-@ standing issue is on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture , Ludwig Fil@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) embark@@ ed on a pilot study &quot; Inter@@ mediate plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools , where an extension of the secondary school secondary school of three to four years was tested .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel to G@@ 9 wherever desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps Da@@ x on jumps
the German stock market has closed up with profits after a long @-@ distance , direction @-@ less and nervous course of trading .
only in the afternoon was a stronger pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock markets for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
M@@ DA@@ X mid @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the index of the euro area decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid gains also booked the trading places in London and Paris .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus .
many stock markets reck@@ on that the markets will be on the market until after the interest rate in the USA and even to the large decline on the meetings .
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and also left deep traces at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies could possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government denied the figures stated in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but eventually lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon stocks rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x peak .
according to a retail@@ er , a positive report by the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect from the weekend .
the investors therefore gave little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
in doing so , investments in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the branch association AC@@ EA took part in the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
Daimler and BMW &apos;s documents increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets were demon@@ ising by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market the return on stock exchange listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Swiss pension index grew by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the euro was 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon .
at mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to US dollars 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shells in a crowd prot@@ esting against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the ru@@ pe@@ an district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police took tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber missi@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately obvious why the used rubber shells , known to be known that they can kill , but traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ rat@@ i would say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflicts since the 10th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den &apos;s youth center Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
waiting for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which investor does come into question is not yet clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Boulevard Street / corner Great street , already purchased a few months ago and let the building on it be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for a holiday settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group that accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went on the offensive from the system @-@ building management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the members of the council and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million Euros of expensive projects have been in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among hor@@ net owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and a member of the board of the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant ring overlooking all the other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus@@ ses must come to expect it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is happening on the grounds of the site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the construction plans were still variable .

Google starts double donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl@@ . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to the publication of the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / was called to be doubled to 11 million $ .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the war torn by the war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach cancer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
in the meantime , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments at around 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease worsen@@ ed completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in a@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as it is reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight in comparison to the Gast@@ ro@@ oma group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 32.@@ 1 % ) and recorded rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I of 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone also added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have attached their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is becoming increasingly popular in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to handle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we have to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US brought a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of the intake of hand dis@@ infection products by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow highly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income from hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age reported the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more involved in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in need of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a nut taste in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young people are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , especially for small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at K@@ ans@@ as University Hospital , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand dis@@ infection products within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four squ@@ ir@@ ers from straw@@ berry @-@ fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was deemed drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated her in the Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah cl@@ ung her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had thrust his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Victoria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection sha@@ w@@ ls and store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspected that the product contained meth@@ anol is a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York City planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them out of her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the secret plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in the event of a rear @-@ end collision , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been slightly injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ bar towards the industrial area and was too late to notice that at the round@@ about two forward @-@ looking cars had stopped .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ ble and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta who stood before .
in case of damage to the car accidents , damages amoun@@ ting to approximately 10,000 euros were incurred , the police sp@@ li@@ ts .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , making the D@@ ons a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths shut down talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of disc@@ ord at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader in the table .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football will be boring Dut@@ ch@@ - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the R@@ angers &apos;s return .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , which now with five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly the same way - but we must continue .
we really need to really support Celtic because that makes the player better .
to stand together is so important .
war@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January @-@ transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ head of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in summer have this season @-@ time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic destination Mik@@ u with a qu@@ ain@@ t document
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , talking with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has pla@@ gu@@ ed himself with a troubles@@ ome k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and did not manage the passage from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts suspended on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ ob &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned my integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted having sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ tar@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ to@@ le when it &apos;s not playing for Celtic Cafe . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admit that the down@@ fall has to end on the field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll get the guys back on track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to win against Hamilton &quot; un@@ attractive . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory , which led them to lead five points ahead of Celtic in the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew who has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the rate of employment for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure higher than the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
dr@@ unken bo@@ thered the flow
as the security staff was unable to paci@@ fy the situation , the staff shou@@ ted the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials were able to take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 per mil@@ le .

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed through the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist so it is not allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go into details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man after wet police chase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persu@@ ades to come from the c@@ anning river &quot; &quot; &quot;
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the c@@ anning river .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water just a few meters away from a police officer attempting to persu@@ ade &quot; him sof@@ tly to return to the shore . &quot;
c@@ anning V@@ ale Police was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a breach incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &apos; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Championship soccer player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins ro@@ de his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to float across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards trying to spy on him and threatening to finish the race
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Racing Victoria &apos;s ste@@ wards have tried to install a Spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what &apos;s best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cobal@@ t test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months for the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at one time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it as I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
Moo@@ dy had previously reported the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I am going to name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if that is the case , they should certainly attach themselves to their n@@ oses because they failed in the attempt to sum@@ mon me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it is going to be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps blame people outside of coaches for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been based on the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching caused him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw up his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the equ@@ ine , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues wrong@@ ly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been like yesterday all day , which was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation into this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man ar@@ rests on driver &apos;s flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycli@@ st and following driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley highway .
the police said that the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with driver &apos;s flight and lowered assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
the cycli@@ st , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , stays in the hospital . he is in a stable state .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring struggling
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high @-@ storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised remark to the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two guys from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the tac@@ kling of his team and said they were only concentrating on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team was confident , as it means they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s coming up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring games when she beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ eur a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it is funny how this always occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and which we view as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to big games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man , who may face a lifel@@ ong penalty due to his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht of Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ saving penalty for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the cafe could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a b@@ ail of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian pass , reports daily with the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driver &apos;s cab torn apart &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed brakes in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left at the last moment , as the police told him .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ maker demoli@@ shed completely .
the driver was seriously injured to a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage to the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ warran@@ ted pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police cared about it and looked at the five pictures , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be addiction , that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search on the computer was done by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was with the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the charges of having in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , viol@@ ating the E@@ ditions and not appearing before the Court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; is to be found in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was given security deposit but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
it was still included before the date of judgment in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn river Inn in the County of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and bushes .
there they are welcomed by federal police officers and for@@ warded to registration .
according to Federal Police information , more refugees arrived at the Munich Main Station in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 am , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south @-@ west awaited &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of assault turbines in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic in the last days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are especially expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday we can see the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the automotive manufacturers show their new products at the IA@@ A .
2015 is above all a move to the compact cars , which are currently selling well .
cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : roughly 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Cart@@ el Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car sector is the Opel Astra , which will be show@@ c@@ ased at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry under the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station , which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra driver Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a more accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade it comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is completely new in the segment .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given law to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel judicial bri@@ gade who had been accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision that was published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel judicial executive prison ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s statements , has now been on the free foot again , was moved to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant against the country of Berlin failed because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions .
but the judges took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case to the re@@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court decides now on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation were author@@ it@@ ative , a compensation was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a weak@@ ening of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they only spoke to a prisoner in April , because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a 2011 decision , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ mate lod@@ ged in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged daily between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines because of missing personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prisoners are therefore trapped again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to fights it should have happened because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of offspring , 19 are expected to drop out in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do in Germany ?
according to statements by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , approximately 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to statements by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany , the following overview con@@ veys the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it was built so far ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing , but above all in affordable rental objects , is dramatic : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments drop out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply .
therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing units would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically after their qualification to help them get started , writes Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial that they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says Mig@@ rations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there has been a political change according to thr@@ ash@@ hardt : from the employment ban on refugees to recognise jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement that restric@@ ts asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - a majority of the point of view prevailed that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market sooner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big barrier to access to the labour market is missing knowledge of German . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the royal road to work integration , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few school@@ ed parents give their children to the kinder@@ garten , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only once more important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to nevertheless convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators is increasing strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for instance by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries , students with no knowledge of German are prepared in the classroom .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ yer from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no federal land prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing to accept refugees , access to the university could be facilit@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a re@@ funds or ac@@ qui@@ escence do not receive any benefits after the asylum application law when they begin their studies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , the latter do not receive a banner , as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to custody .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far , to be eligible for B@@ af@@ e@@ j , this period will be reduced to 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ o@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually give the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ church right to a new state @-@ religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic well @-@ being federation , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also include obligations .
thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree to clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take advantage of religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Muslims &apos; Central Council , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stra@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , pushing down discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade ago an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general equality law .
but it learns very slowly how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German demand for a long time and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany are committed must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , &quot; says Dr Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requires all the newcom@@ ers to hand over health cards at the same time .
achievements could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to iron out so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum application law does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , the doctors make the language barriers so easy .
even so far , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are less aware of their illnesses than other patients .
not only in hospitals but also in medical practices interpre@@ ting costs need to be taken over , it challenges them .
many refugees , however , would have helped many more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee camps , for example , there is clearly more disability , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ related information .
but with some of the other symptoms German doctors make clear of their training , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bet@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is possibly even allevi@@ ation in sight by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , some refugees even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass examinations again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most people suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attacks and death troubles .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the welfare offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses in the social offices will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ez@@ h invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Promenade invites into the man@@ ege on the brick @-@ was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; passion &quot; - this motto represents the current stage of maneu@@ vering .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the family thus is in the blood of the gift for fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well cocktail with world @-@ city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says managing director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometre tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus Festival impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films it wants to easily record the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon fill@@ ets , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus are fascinated by the sensation of fingers and agi@@ lity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic for different animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also commented : &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t do well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every mat@@ ing unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege .
so the upper@@ most requirement : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is safe , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more 200 people , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
the Circus Festival invites to its performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 p.m .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4@@ pm .
Thursday is fam@@ il@@ y@@ day , for the show at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au daily is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall soon spread over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with calls .
last month , they had pro@@ str@@ ated him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman for Democratic Change Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of parliament that immunity will end in parliament and as soon as they leave Parliament , parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction will result in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and diversified portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will focus on providing previously un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage one has called the place of origin of the Sili@@ con Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the turning of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must stand before the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider image for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have noticed most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement will last in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a reasonable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey haven &apos;t travelled to Croatia , which means Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u should start Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven away from the distant hopes of leading the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship @-@ Fest : the Com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with their emphasis on style and substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if reality domin@@ ates isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness .
the best thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ ed through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often lag behind to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a staff of telephone counsel@@ ing it told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My key role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at home is clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends are one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration on this weekend with the completely re@@ designed cou@@ lis@@ se to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k ?
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is playing with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish champion since they are not only aiming for the eligi@@ bility for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club , with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and look back at ease , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris Team , which could hold a 2 : 2 accident on the weekend against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian cas@@ ement was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö Defense , before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the mid@@ field , a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far from Kevin Tra@@ pps pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead PS@@ G itself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill if he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shot which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season goal after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had raised a left flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent match from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi turned a gate at the end .
the coach from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league that has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core ga@@ thers $ 2.5 billion by share sales
the Glen@@ core mining giant in Switzerland , which is affected by the falling prices of raw materials , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday as part of its huge debt collection plan .
the London @-@ registered Glen@@ core said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth $ 1.6 billion to pay off its own debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of rights to cover has led to a rapid increase at the top of the London stock exchange on the early Wednesday morning .
the share jumped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sales as part of the more extensive plans to pay around a third of his $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion equi@@ ties worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns about long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodities prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and rep@@ lies President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will be host of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan on this evening at a state D@@ iner after the two leaders have led bilateral discussions .

XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on its way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi address a series of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ sp@@ ying of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago FC Bayern was just ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner League winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion league champion , twice champion league champion , twice champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advises that he was already in Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and that was also the registered cover of the Bayern Munich .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern Munich .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , the Rot@@ es switched off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays down variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown dis@@ rupted when he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it with the cast of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian tigh@@ tened .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they handle the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said at first .
the only black person , and she is a groove that is struck by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement achieved Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter across the country and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against col@@ lateral .
in February the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the launch of nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or had already made the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
the competition show , which had just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task in time with which he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E said ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , he gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he carries any gru@@ dge over that .
he has just so happy to have done what he did .
crowds of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins turned a chance to climb in one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two rows , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 intern@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go all the way into the game .
the designated tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ se@@ ater hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the gh@@ ol@@ ts well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good during ( kick training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three wins at the end of the seventh session , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Field Aaron Hi@@ cks achieved a Bun@@ te , and Simon made his second bas@@ eman Brian Great Patri@@ cian Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the lef@@ ty Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in this season in the Major League , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe won a Double Play
after putting an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth inner court , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game from an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two bow@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been stri@@ cken before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;d wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman , Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z scored his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third rider Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , ran another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers arrived in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t hit particularly well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were about three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the age of the throw .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder der@@ ision , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be defeated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who came in there should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden was sharing on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the capital of Hessen have been prepared in recent days for this case .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily sign up there .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
over the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse according to the government presi@@ dency of the government responsible for the first time .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective thinking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing up@@ side down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase of international assistance on site for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again has introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , and no one will be returned to Hungary .
Germany , too , did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it was agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement which could include a certain number of refugees from Austria a day after Germany , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the general director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those who needed protection would also mo@@ urn it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view has been strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now manage a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge strength effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to seal the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary plans to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from searching for alternative routes across Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , eye witnesses reported that thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Satur@@ n@@ moon &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ ends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the moon is easily stag@@ gering around the ring plane .
although this motion is only small , but too large for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) of Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
thus , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , which sp@@ rou@@ t water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing Munich several weeks in Munich
the 1860 München must abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old submitted an inquiry to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama was compla@@ ining about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper , looking at the possible commitment of a non @-@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the six@@ ties , however , initially presented a defensive man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his bra@@ ins , Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie could return to the team training again next week .
the Austrian national player is supposed to start running on Thursday already on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent collision at the head .
contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line@@ age are often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively large amounts of sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits also support the vision , the immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone does not tell you how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet dishes .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first blow @-@ tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the alpine side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and during the night to Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings strong rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western current .
on the night of the Alps , the hair@@ dryers pass through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ or@@ ns with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can reach up to the adjacent centre and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday there are stor@@ my hair dryers for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to accumulate on the alpine hill@@ side .
here , rain sets on , which stops until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be accounted for in the south of the Alps .
on Thursday morning , the blow dryer runs out of the air , as a result a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east goes over Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind is blowing heavily up to stor@@ my weather , and temperatures are rising significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south on the weekend it gets sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutscher The@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority .
the square is symbo@@ lically present that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time , he found the city as a sin@@ ful sin@@ ner ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions should have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome , according to historians .
then , with his theses , Luther began the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gil@@ ded crown &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now has been published with splendid pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt worked for about three years in his bi@@ ble project for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles which dedic@@ ate themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quote by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the particular situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant hymn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here education has already happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out to carry me back with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to restore art to more significance in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed manner : &quot; the perception of image worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is sup@@ planted .
artists have another desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt asks the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images , let them act , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture looks for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ alto @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ alto @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art to be : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his pictures . &quot;
I don &apos;t care to completely capture the Bible , but rather to select the mysterious themes that are important to him .
&quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we are talking about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler as well as the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway , it was already finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failure in politics and administration caused hard@@ ship , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will go down in October , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck , the first member of the community in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work on the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its assistance in dealing with the problems arising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach ( DF@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the minister of state Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
soccer can and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some federal states support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professionals put a clear sign when they will wear the stamp &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot@@ ran@@ ger instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees is all about , nobody can look away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can make football allies , no , we must use our beam strength , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director , Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large common work in German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 licens@@ ors had started their own projects in their respective locations was great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , provides 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already cried out all the time for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief of the Board of Management is losing an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the head of state of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the case of the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost bloo@@ dless , he was power@@ less , then he got out of the road - he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ substitute pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen swe@@ ated a picture and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a reserve driver for the two stam@@ mer@@ ing drivers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button for the night race in Singapore , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
review of Public International Law as Part of Federal Law ( Bv@@ M )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus were defini@@ tively crushed in the first group match of the Europa League .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ fen@@ nel will not only change its trunk position on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change at the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of home owner Roman natur@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football team praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ ank@@ le left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ceful statement by fellow player R@@ eus that the final draft for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IA@@ A fair of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategic paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and spe@@ edy access to digital radio communication .
to test new technology , a test track is currently being built on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks can be imposed on the driver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany plans to use internationally in order to raise the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras capturing the environment and processing the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans still look skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not think about it at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed expect to travel by 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in a traffic jam 45 percent .
a good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

according to present conditions , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf will only aim at the title fight between September 25 and October 4 .
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to take the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term partnership in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing and we became Europe champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United attracted a serious injury on his right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , in the meantime it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of sep@@ t@@ ember at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his initial reluct@@ ant attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely opa@@ que work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort has been done : to indulge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have incar@@ n@@ ated 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special highlight : a leather h@@ osen outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l &apos;s old ted@@ dy bear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be seen in the exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he wore his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught himself the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he did not have to pay the models for his first show of fashion .

jewel@@ ery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as Fashion N@@ ish
in the past , the long stit@@ ching machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to meter .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in great quantities for customers , which they worked for , for example , to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead , the mode is important again .
fashion has played a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , and was then replaced by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt lists some examples : top in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is borrow@@ ed from past styles , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
mo@@ dest@@ ine P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien along with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , roughly 80 percent of sales have been cut .
private shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products barely reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass production is much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports weak@@ en , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to score with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outer branch of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Lower Saxony - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine locks small glob@@ ules at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took some inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a piece of mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends shouldn &apos;t be stir@@ red , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reform will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants &quot; reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is important because it has a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a legally right business environment and making the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ease controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as announced in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to provide consumers with a significantly higher dose of ven@@ om . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury , that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the catches cannot be sold .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low bur@@ dened that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the fall in Kl@@ einf@@ elden is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal for humans , which is heavily enriched over the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government is therefore cau@@ ti@@ ously warning that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system particularly in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its home page with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants come across more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of the total emit@@ ted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanently and completely exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from the paper in March .
over the past year , European warnings on mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
