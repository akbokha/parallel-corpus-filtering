the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of Part I on hed@@ ging measures .
the objective of the safegu@@ ards established in this Convention is timely discovery of the turno@@ ff of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive activities for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a branch off the risk of early discovery .
in order to reach the goal specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a backup measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial intervention and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified for the specified length of the material for a certain period of time .
when performing their investigations , the organization makes 3 full use of the community &apos;s security system after Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the core material community in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
with the use of their securing measures , the community shall use de processes and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age as determined and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements .
a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , sent , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
( C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ;
( e ) method for valu@@ ing accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;

the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) Ur@@ an ( or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circuit under the letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) the core material which is suitable for the composition and purity for the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope rich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for nuclear materials under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , however , the association and the community consult each other for the application of appropriate hed@@ ging measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for nuclear materials under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the backup activities following this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and

on the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the Organisation sets up a conden@@ sed inventory list of the entire core material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory according to the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EA has decided to contribute to the special action programme set at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sources problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound to force of the agreement within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this objective .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central links to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the Organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement .
the Organ@@ izer direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which is made up of the funds which the Member States contribute to the Special Inter@@ action Account ; this account is referred to and used by the Organization as ste@@ ward , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the Special Off@@ er@@ account is separated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ sensitive notes of the member state , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the concerned state to order the organization as ste@@ ward of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the depos@@ iting point of the organization in the concerned country .
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time ;

C ) E@@ ach Member State may request the payments before the above mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional draw on the cash or the deb@@ tors to cover expenses for the special loans and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of such loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC :
III ) the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its other lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
( VII ) The extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
any special loan is used to finance a clearly re@@ inde@@ xed and rapidly payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral management ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the methods and practices that are paid for by ordinary means of the organization funded development loans , which is to be taken into account in the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the means of the special financial account may not be used in lieu of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which are bound by a loan or loan for a programme or project that has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .

special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts to the payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that reserves them .
any special loan has to be rejected by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which , in particular , the origin of the funds is stated .
the proceeds from any special loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which may be bene@@ fici@@ aries of a special loan granted at the time of the loan granted .
the capital re@@ payments of the special loans are due to the special financial account and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until full awar@@ ding of all special loans for the EEC , the Administrator is informed of the projects and programmes approved by the directors for the examination by the directors .
during the time of payment of the special loans , the administrator supervis@@ es the EW@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special loans and the expenses made for this .
as soon as possible , the Administrator obli@@ ges the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organisation to this account closure .
after full payment of the special loans , the administrator of the EEC shall receive a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special financial account .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transactions account , the amounts payable on the account and the amounts paid out from the account and the withdraw@@ als made to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until full issu@@ ance of the means of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or plans financed by specialized services or any other questions affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation may agree to , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due .
if the total capital amount of all special loans taken by the bene@@ fici@@ aries is returned to the Member States under Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement needs the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .

at each stand@@ by loan , the B@@ IS would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions growing without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as with any extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit @-@ opening fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawings were not made before the end of a month following the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the trac@@ ts would take place in the currencies available at the B@@ IS at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the funds of the Bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applied by the B@@ IS at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the B@@ IS must obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , then the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the corresponding margin raised by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with amm@@ el and lamb
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set regulations on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows :
- Fresh or refriger@@ ated amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in battle body weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina agrees to ensure that the annual quantity actually executed does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement shall consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community takes the protection clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year .
the Community obli@@ ges to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products recorded by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the entrance of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount set out under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of de@@ ple@@ tion mentioned under number 5 .
the total volume referred to as number 2 is set to a total weight of 23@@ ,000 metric tons on the day of the Greek accession to the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes all to prevent market development which could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community makes arrangements so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ mining due to the execution of the Ord@@ in@@ ance on the sale of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be carried out at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
these terms can be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and , in particular , Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agre@@ ements .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting certain export licenses for the products mentioned in this agreement .
the Community under@@ takes to make all necessary arrangements so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products originates in Argentina from the submission of an export license granted by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government .
the details of the application of this system are set out in such a way that it is possible to wai@@ ve the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods in question .
in implementing regulations , it is also determined that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community informs the quantities in regular intervals for which export licenses have been granted ; these data may be deco@@ ded in accordance with destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly reviews the tendency of the hammer , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of importance to the target of the number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will be carried out under the agreement not named under the agreement .
the Committee discusses all questions arising from the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount arising from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is set in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and , on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary to be necessary .
I would be grateful if you would like to share the consent of your government .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :

an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat
I honor to refer to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the determination of provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy are exist@@ ential , and that it must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb in these markets is not impaired , I honour the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - Fresh or refriger@@ ated amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will ensure access to the market of the Community in the agreement fixed in the agreement for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Zealand ob@@ tains assur@@ ances that the normal sales of its amm@@ el and lamb will not be affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the amount stated in fact does not exceed the stipulated quantity .
the prescribed amounts are carried out in conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using this agreement to exploit new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties shall consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee referred to in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .

taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be carried out at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular by giving no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
the Community under@@ takes to make all necessary arrangements so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand depends on the submission of an export license granted by the notified body notified by the New Zealand Government .
the details of the application of this system are set out in such a way that it is possible to wai@@ ve the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods in question .
in implementing regulations , it is also determined that the competent New Zealand Authority informs the competent authority of the community at regular intervals , where export licenses have been granted ; these data may be deco@@ ded in accordance with destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .

in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Uruguay on trade with amm@@ el and lamb
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set regulations on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows :
- Fresh or refriger@@ ated amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( collective tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common tari@@ ff tari@@ ff ) ;
- Fro@@ zen H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( collective tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the common tari@@ ff tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are established following the Community for the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay has committed itself to ensuring that the annual quantity actually executed does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement shall consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an agreed access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the de@@ ple@@ tion to imports of products recorded by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st rate of 10 b.@@ H .
with regard to the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay has changed the quantity established under number 2 according to the extent of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of de@@ ple@@ tion mentioned under number 5 .
the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is set to 5 800 metric tons of car@@ c@@ ass with the time of the Greek accession to the community .
the community under@@ takes all to prevent market development that could compromise the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community makes arrangements so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meats is not under@@ mining the sales of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an she@@ ep@@ skin due to the execution of the regulation .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be carried out at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
these terms can be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and , in particular , Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agre@@ ements .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by providing export licenses for the products mentioned in this agreement for the products mentioned in this agreement .
the Community under@@ takes to make all necessary arrangements so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products originates from the presentation of an export license granted by the authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in implementing regulations , the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals communic@@ ates the quantities that have been issued for export licenses ; these data may be deco@@ ded in accordance with destination country if necessary .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and , on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Uruguay on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you confirmed the consent of your government with this letter .

the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all states that have been assigned to the Convention and the European Economic Community , or any objection within the meaning of Article 2 , as well as the time of entry into force of this additional protocol pursuant to Article 2 .
the General Secretary of the European Economic Community also quotes any action , notification or communication relating to this Convention .
whereas it is highly desirable if Member States support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood group determination ,
whereas this mutual support is only possible if the condition and use of these re@@ agents for blood group determination are subject to the provisions set out by the Member States and the necessary facilities and exemp@@ tions for their import are granted -
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this agreement , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group identification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group determination and to determine blood in@@ compati@@ bilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any contracting party can restrict the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to the determination of the blood group by a declaration directed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe by a declaration directed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by contacting the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the contractual parties undertake to leave re@@ agents to the blood group determination against reimbur@@ sement of the costs of their extraction , preparation and promotion , as well as the purchase price of other contractual parties , which are urgently needed , provided they have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for the determination of the blood group will be provided to other parties only on condition that there is no profit , that they are only used for medical purposes and only delivered to the parties designated by the governments involved .
each sending of re@@ agents to the blood group identification must be accompanied by a certificate that they were produced in accordance with the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its structure represent an administrative arrangement which can be amended or amended by the governments of the contracting parties .

following the entry into force of this Convention , the Council of Europe &apos;s Committee of Ministers may invite any non @-@ Member State to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notes the date of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with a period of one year by notification to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance stated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appearances should not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic characteristics ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by continuously dil@@ uting the re@@ agent to be investigated on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively for volume of blood cell in@@ undation in total volume .
in the case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has defined International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating sti@@ cker , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flow .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin of O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml according to the definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label is one year after the last reasonable efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents indicated on the label depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ oric acid in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origins for blood group identification must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used if necessary to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents issued are stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is prob@@ able that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group identification may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective component in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin .
on each box is a black and white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ producing ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the container attached contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ producing ,

in addition , it is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ation against an in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of serum should in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( Group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .
if an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ und@@ ations of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required when the same tests are performed with the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a for the determination of the R@@ h group may be changed if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells , containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D .
