this document is a summary of the European Public Opinion Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you require further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Wir@@ ing thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a mental disorder where patients alternate with periods of abnormal mood ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ia ) .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for treating moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and proph@@ yl@@ actic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used to quickly control increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
for both diseases , the solution may be applied to inhal@@ e or the enam@@ el tablets in patients who difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other drugs at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably appears primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree as the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ chat@@ el contributes to norm@@ alizing brain activity , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing re@@ appearing .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol in another study comparing the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence to 160 patients with whom the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced clinical symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented the re@@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled Zu@@ cken ) , T@@ rem@@ or ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , nausea , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l against the risks .
in addition , the committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be taken into account when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ dosis dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal risk with ari@@ pi@@ dosis in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ conduc@@ tion ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ dosis .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , have to be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events occurred in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ dosis .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma , or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events involving Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ure@@ mia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , care must be taken care of when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of ari@@ pi@@ dosis , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical trial involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be performed .
in case of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ aboli@@ zation , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ ot@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ aboli@@ zers .
considering the joint administration of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be performed .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level before the start of the companion therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be used with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ anism concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of aria per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ acryl@@ ate / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ acryl@@ ate ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and the concerns generated in reproductive studies for animals , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with aria pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from aria pra@@ z@@ ema and 13.@@ 1 % in placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from aria pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from aria pra@@ z@@ ema treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from aria treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with aria @-@ treated patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , as reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ zo@@ l , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ doses with ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no deaths .
there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with ari@@ pi@@ dosis ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the effectiveness of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ li@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is im@@ par@@ ted .
Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a and a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at put@@ ative .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who attended the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significant reduction in the rate of rel@@ apse , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo , showed a significantly higher rate of response .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ anism did not show superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ anism showed a versus placebo @-@ superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia on such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features that did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ fication of ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean time of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ da for extensive metabol@@ isers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in poor &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as with a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a stimulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in respect of eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ ot@@ ene were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o ari@@ pi@@ dosis , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional safety pad toxic@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no importance for the clinical application .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent secondary kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile of apes after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the bile of apes , and are well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle @-@ grade ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should continue with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ dosis .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma , or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events involving Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from aria pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ li@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is im@@ par@@ ted .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ anism did not show superior efficacy against placebo .
the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) was found in a relative bio@@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l was compared to healthy volunteers .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile of apes after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle @-@ grade ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the resor@@ ption and to minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection into the del@@ to@@ ide@@ us muscle or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ fer@@ ment of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines already used for conservation or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medication to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients suffering from a@@ gi@@ tism and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder .
in case a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with respect to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ ot@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ conduc@@ tion ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ dosis .
clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and irregular heart@@ beat ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ure@@ mia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ative was higher compared to the after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly and con@@ currently received lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of ari@@ pi@@ dosis , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in the case of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ aboli@@ zing , the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ic acid compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can can be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level before the start of the companion therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ative was greater compared to the after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials using Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ated injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were considered to be possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from aria treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from aria pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from aria pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with aria @-@ treated patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , as reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ zo@@ l , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the ari@@ pi@@ ro@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as ag@@ gra@@ ding and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms of toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from bas@@ eline at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for Plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar effectiveness in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a decreased number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who attended the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher response rate was shown for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which were sometimes not related to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , companion therapy with ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ole resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ gu@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l showed herself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % larger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablets ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time up to reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration after repeated administration of systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 m@@ g. respectively .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application , no safety @-@ related concerns were observed after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety pad toxic@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore they have only limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent secondary kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in people .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from apes to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold medium steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a study where 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of which about three quarters had previously received anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in combination with chemotherapy or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy .
if only those patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators like time to the worsen@@ ing of disease and survival .
in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , these indicators showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it should also not be applied to patients who have low neutral number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils before the treatment starts .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was no longer , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy drugs , it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 The European Commission issued a licence to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ anes throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ based therapy is not shown ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neu@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during abrasion therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is to inter@@ rupt until an improvement is achieved to degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose modifications in patients with mild to moderate liver function impair@@ ment ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose modifications in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data to safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nano @-@ articul@@ ated formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have considerably different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ sives .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which are not effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised not to give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised about a sperm preservation prior to treatment , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can affect the per@@ version and ability to handle machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most noticeable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was in three cases severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , back pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , chest pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscular weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence are possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ prescription medication that promotes the ag@@ gregation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dependen@@ cy .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ oms@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ re@@ ep@@ tor and , due to the alb@@ um@@ inal protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic line in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , appears to be an accumulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two approved un@@ incorporated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel alone , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a reduced general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time until progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel according to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredient exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ ular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than with a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of the human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is metabol@@ ised primarily with 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ination of the unchanged drug with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel resulted in a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available to patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and above light light for more than 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the holder of the licensing agreement will provide the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials prior to the market launch :
• Educ@@ ational brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing supplement . • With clear visual representation of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes for transport by patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; refer@@ ral medicine &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood protein values that might occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood donation is not possible before the intervention , and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml may be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection may also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have given appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be controlled prior to treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which em@@ powers it to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ sen@@ amed was compared to intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections in a vein as part of a primary study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to either Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the start of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were placed on Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
ir@@ is amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations , evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , a permit for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .

to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a major electrical orthop@@ a@@ edic operation in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial symptoms and results may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week via IV application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
initial symptoms and - consequ@@ ent effects may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for controlling the initial symptoms .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the repeat cy@@ te quantity for ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the repeat number of &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l have risen relative to bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after a further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the repeat cy@@ te quantity for ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ed foods is required , should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection may be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients suffering from an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ chi@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive either Ab@@ se@@ amed or any other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous don@@ or program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disorder ; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl a month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the eti@@ ology value should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum toxic@@ ity , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the aden@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the repeat cy@@ te index ) , is low ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te figures are normal , and if no other reason for loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ines if the concentration of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in is increased beyond the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically vi@@ d@@ ent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ co@@ ded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially for an underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial value of &gt; 13 g / dl an elevated risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy returned when a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in @-@ vitro examinations on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , retin@@ al thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ v@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin treatment .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the most technologi@@ cally recovered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that has been isolated from the urine of an@@ aesthetic patients .
it could be shown by means of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ ome , 64 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five great controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to controls due to several common malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in regular inspections .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival can not be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy to achieve a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels obtained after injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated for three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies with almost the 20@@ times of the recommended weekly dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has led to decreased f@@ ö@@ tot@@ em body weight , a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .

the holder of the licensing agreement is obliged to undertake the studies and additional measures to pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as agreed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and to carry out the risk management plan assumed by the CH@@ MP accordingly .
according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for human use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • with receipt of new information that could have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • within 60 days after reaching an important ( drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • by E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time appearing or reinforced chest pain ) , the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) has occurred - for example , if you have already performed such a drop of blood .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which is reg@@ ain@@ ing again for further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before the start of treatment .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ie after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ie , it will break your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back to normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion sign due to inadequate heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ al@@ emia in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your levels of red blood dy@@ es ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ sen@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic occurrence ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as little as possible .
this risk should be weighed very carefully against the advantages derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if in the past thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in case you are cancer patient , bear in mind that Ab@@ sen@@ amed like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumour .
if you have an or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic surgery before treatment start with Ab@@ se@@ amed , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood @-@ graf@@ ting after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medications or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( Medium to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may be able to arrange certain blood tests to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia is concerned , the dose can be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia is responding to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a low traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like h@@ inf@@ in ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium two times a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedies against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 older women were involved in o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined for a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was investigated for a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , a total of 3@@ 57 patients were tested in two studies and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood returned to normal or at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney ail@@ ments , reactions to the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors who prescri@@ be acet@@ yl@@ ation for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a licence to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • Con@@ tract contra@@ indication in pregnancy and nursing women • Re@@ quired for appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous 5 mg intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and teenagers Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data on safety and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with the intake of calcium and vitamin D before the onset of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , respectively twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental surgery , no data is available , whether the dis@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ en roses in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe side effects reported in cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid was associated with ren@@ al dysfunction , which was associated as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the changes in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured year before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and reduced ren@@ al function were in a clinical study of o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area , especially in cancer patients , about o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area in a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the event of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an IV in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated with either a bone density filter ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 1.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric level frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on the lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatments significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ al neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic stem were taken one year after the third annual dose .
micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in trab@@ ecular bone volume compared to placebo in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta versus placebo .
bone reconstruction markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - collagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in intervals during the study period .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dosage of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effects on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , in comparison to placebo treatment , the BM@@ D increased the total dose and fem@@ oral neck at all times .
more than 24 months compared to placebo treatments , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total frac@@ tures and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients , the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a decrease in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in the placebo @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of acet@@ os@@ tin was not inferior to the one @-@ week administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at based on the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of cit@@ ric acid compared to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain and pain influence after 6 months in comparison with the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial were included in the follow @-@ up phase .
from 143 with ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response could be maintained with 141 of patients treated with acet@@ yl@@ ate , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , for an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
afterwards the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large circul@@ atory cycle with half @-@ life cycles t ½ α@@ 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β is 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long phase of elimination with a terminal elim@@ inations calf &apos;s time t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent rapid resor@@ ption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body clearance amounts irrespective of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clearance of met@@ to@@ chro@@ mium @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems met@@ aboli@@ zed substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in 64 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
the result is that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance down to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the cit@@ ric acid .
there are no statements for this population because of severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
studies on dogs allowed single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , 6 times the recommended humane @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid was administered in rats at a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 6@@ x of the human therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , corresponding to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point occurred .
the most common complic@@ ation in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ se of long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
at rats , one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages starting from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the preparation and conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 is in force and works before and while the product is marketed .
risk Management Plan The holder of licensing agreement is committed to conducting studies and additional activities for drug vi@@ gil@@ ance that are presented in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the regulatory submission and all subsequent R@@ MP versions approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the current statements on safety , drug vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens produced from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone conversion is too fast , and new bone material is arranged un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by returning the bone structure back to normal , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and giving the bone strength again .
if you are in a dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you are using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you take drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drink , worry that you have sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
when the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before finishing the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
at present it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw@@ s were primarily reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are advised to carry out the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , for at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. can be recommended or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you require further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , A@@ comp@@ lia will suffer with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • the overweight people ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and furthermore one or more I
in addition , four studies were carried out on more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking compared to a placebo .
the studies on the setting of smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tissue .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants since it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

he recommends diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it also occurs in patients who - besides obesity - have no apparent risks , can cause depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other nearby persons ) should point out that it is necessary to monitor the re@@ occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months were closed by studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort , has not been studied , is believed to be the simultaneous addition of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors to the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant
over overweight patients as well as in patients with obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects that have occurred under treatment in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight reduction and accompanying metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significant if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding placebo rate ( for undes@@ irable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ irable effects &lt; 1 % ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rarely ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä
only slight symptoms were observed in a follow @-@ up study in which a limited number of people were given one @-@ time charges of up to 300 mg .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the bas@@ eline , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

the difference between the average weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % accounted for by weight reduction . n ei@@ m ar@@ z

influence of food : subjects that received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the diet or after a fat @-@ rich meal , showed a 67 % increased C@@ MA@@ x or 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C in the case of the food supply .
patients with black skin color can have an up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ as@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5.3 prec@@ lin@@ ical data on the safety of the following undes@@ irable effects that were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were considered to be potentially relevant for clinical application :
in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which permitted a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects on fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances were observed .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and with lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Opinion Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , causing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional injection of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ y@@ anine in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ze ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tos across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attacks or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated initial liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme values will be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient continues with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical app@@ rais@@ al up to the preliminary examination of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ cavity or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as two @-@ person combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on the occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the incidence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescription doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the frac@@ ture incidence calculated was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes for a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment should be cancelled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies to investigate the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not exercise relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical co@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs , which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
this is due to the reduction in hyper@@ insulin resistance caused by pregnant women and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown .
these lead to a temporary alteration of the tower and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on AL@@ T @-@ climbs quad@@ ru@@ ple the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or respectively .
since the market launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in groups treated with compar@@ ators .
in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , Fra@@ c@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have activated the activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome proliferation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of treatment , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients suffering from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a continuous statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week examination of type 2 diabetes patients .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as minor , but clin@@ ically in@@ significant elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
in comparison to placebo , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while lower scores were observed under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized into groups who received in addition to the already existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular treatment of either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it was demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , plasma volume enlar@@ ging with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centri@@ city hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e occurred in mice , rats , dogs and apes .
this is due to the reduced suscep@@ ti@@ bility of hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , the rat induced higher incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ones resulted in increased frequency of colon@@ os@@ por@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frac@@ ture incidence calculated was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in a further study over two years , the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in clinical studies more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed consistently a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both through an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level .
although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ vit@@ alization and sec@@ ul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is not associated with cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level which indicated that the blood sugar level was similar to that of another human insulin analog .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the packing supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were predomin@@ ant in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ cord in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily when a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy may have altered the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin of animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage required .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia are less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which are going through several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account any possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supple@@ mentation of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by means of a proven help person or by glucose , administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total length of time is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites shown by the split are active .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
additionally , the doses of acet@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tu@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the rapidly working insulin must first be re@@ ared , followed by the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tu@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling , which are going through several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total length of time is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or plaster k@@ not ( &quot; stones &quot; d. h. large amounts of urine cryst@@ alli@@ ze that may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
plaster sei@@ zur@@ es may still occur during the first months of treatment ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ o@@ ic use other drugs for the prevention of rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months .
the medicine is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were under 6 mg / dl for the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received an average dose of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once daily , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl for the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ inate deposits ( including a disease known or currently present from the medical history and / or arthritis arthritis ) .
if the Ser@@ um har@@ n@@ age level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety were not fully investigated so far ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other drug @-@ curing medicines , it can lead to acute pois@@ oning during the course of the treatment , because the lowering of the serum har@@ n@@ age level may initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han@@ sis syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
during phase 3 clinical studies slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the beginning of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and in the further course , according to clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ war did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a inhi@@ bit of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x was associated with an increase in the exposure of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without the need for a dose adjustment for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily demonstrated an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acids that contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ X by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancy may not include side effects of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ dy group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all groups of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials , no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients for up to 4 years treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients years ) , according to the indications occasionally .

the lowering of the serum pole level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and remained permanent throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ Pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cholesterol &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( ie h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of the acid acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ aric acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had an acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the serum har@@ n@@ age level was reduced to &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a disease in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against g@@ ushing ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out bone , which in 54 % of the patients had a complete disappearance of the no@@ des until month 24 .
increased SH@@ E values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ X ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by dose of simple and multiple doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportion@@ ately .
for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at doses between 120 mg and 300 mg there is an increase in AU@@ C higher than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ X is about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , there was no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum di@@ ac@@ ic acid concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 litres after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bind to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant via the concentration range achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ely glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as an imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as an imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency following in@@ gest@@ ing multiple doses of 80@@ mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency did not change the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the middle total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a consequence of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and ur@@ inary composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it has been established that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
in case of high doses , which were about 3 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by lowering the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ ower and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause in which there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down to the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data that stem from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in regards to increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the share of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE exactly matches the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cers , ul@@ cers ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) , fever bli@@ sters .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be used .
it must not be used in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE on the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow the instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• Dur@@ ing the day , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cers , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are given only with special care ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients while taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor is therefore advised to draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out , in the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ viral pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side @-@ effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
o@@ ste@@ on rose of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regi@@ men administered intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available that indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients needing a max@@ illary surgical procedure reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ onic nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their om@@ is@@ sion .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled week of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately addressed before the start of treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials in conjunction with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or nursing women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ onic nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis patients .
however , the serum phosph@@ ats up to &lt; 8.0 mg / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats occurred up to ≤ 2.0 mg / L ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate sequence of an oral over@@ dose can cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase of the intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ a can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in o@@ steopor@@ otic individuals .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) than in the group under al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
the therapeutic equi@@ valence of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ centre study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III trials , the medium @-@ sized asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur rate and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction was achieved compared to placebo ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo - 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new flu@@ idi@@ zed frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption of an intraven@@ ous dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) was not a clin@@ ically important change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats revealed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily divided into soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate approximately 50 % of the radio@@ actively selected substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ og@@ s .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearance passed not 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems in humans .
resor@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a meal , the mean area under the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) was for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 n@@ g • h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 mirrors ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time until reaching the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy in the liver and then met@@ aboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
elimination with the addition of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy subjects was the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the f@@ og@@ s after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate that is not deposited in bone is ex@@ cre@@ ted quickly over the urine .
although there are no clinical data available , it can be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function .

paragraph is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ oc@@ ate with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a year of treatment ( e.g. examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
furthermore , shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ oc@@ ate is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ ant@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ant@@ ee , as the recommended dosage or dosage of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events , including immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; change@@ over@@ s of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
following a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ oc@@ ate should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations )
after moving from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ ate , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after the change@@ over .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ant@@ ee to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a low clearance substance , an adjustment of the lawyer can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be in@@ stituted intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection must be maintained by immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ant therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments can later be required , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change after the transplan@@ t in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ant therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ ate must be converted a gra@@ ft receiver of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ ee , so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to agra@@ f once a day , treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there are no clinical experience with adv@@ an@@ es@@ - , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and supervision of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ oc@@ ate when mig@@ rating from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the blood level in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical app@@ rais@@ al of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case by means of full blood @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ low controls .
it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to agra@@ ph , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ oc@@ ate is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is usually in the blood during the first time after liver transplan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with n@@ ag and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance treatment of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; change@@ over@@ s of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the Sal@@ ardi@@ erte formulation Adv@@ ant@@ ee .
in addition to proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the Sal@@ ardi@@ erte formulation Adv@@ ant@@ f .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a lowering of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ cul@@ ature in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during a treatment with a lawyer ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is advisable , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases Pro@@ gra@@ f used to observe a chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ oc@@ ate agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , over@@ loading and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective shield with a high protection factor .
if patients who use tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ oc@@ ate Hard@@ case , ret@@ ar@@ ert , lac@@ tose present , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood level with the simultaneous addition of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinct interaction was associated with anti @-@ boy@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the elevated oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduces the clear@@ ances of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus can increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially l@@ essen the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born to possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) is recommended .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ alkal@@ i ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the non @-@ efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the following are reported in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ics , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with paragraph .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high bonding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells , dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ -@@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung Transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recent multi@@ centre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , who received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were changed from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Hor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute transplan@@ t rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) for transplan@@ t transplan@@ t patients in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome with the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was significantly lower .
a multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation , which were obtained after a random@@ ized procedure tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml to 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after transplan@@ tation showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via bile .
in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to paragraph 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ ant@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the Sal@@ ardi@@ erte formulation Adv@@ ant@@ ee .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , over@@ loading and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the deficiency of factor V@@ III ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or preventing bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of V@@ III deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form the human coag@@ ulation factor V@@ III .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union , called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood vessels with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor V@@ III .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor V@@ III , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosing The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor V@@ III deficiency , on the location and the extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor V@@ III activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment process , a reasonable determination of the factor V@@ III @-@ plasma level is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor V@@ III , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor V@@ III per kg body weight should be given within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of V@@ III plasma activities is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor V@@ III therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the dosing speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor V@@ III is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor V@@ III Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor V@@ III , whereby the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor V@@ III product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tr@@ ated ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the application of Factor V@@ III during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s experienced in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of Factor V@@ III ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the coag@@ ulation factor V@@ III @-@ mirror occurred in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , 145 children and adults 2 with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ V@@ III ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 days of exposure with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , a F@@ V@@ III inhibit@@ or was observed in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients aged under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ V@@ III ≤ 2 % ) following previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial were 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E inhibit@@ ors to factor V@@ III .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ le gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id responses ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor V@@ III acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline value of factor V@@ III activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced that the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially announces that the company will withdraw its application for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surrounds and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically altered to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a Aden@@ o@@ virus , which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene , which is not defective in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill cells when DNA cannot be restored .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient representing Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions presented to him , some questions were still unclear .
based on the inspection of the documents initially submitted , the CH@@ MP will draw up a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not proven that the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ anc@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the return consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nose @-@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous membranes ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is a tablet twice a day , which should be taken with or without food by a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patient under aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( elevated blood pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ o@@ ia ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ intestinal function ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms cease .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , l@@ ul@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tives that are applied per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ ally as abnormal r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ oses ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ ha@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy has not been checked for this patient population and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze have not been checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce the dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headache or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is to be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours prior to the performance of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in clinical trials with Des@@ oxy@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and those treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ oxy@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vi@@ vo , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ ob@@ ols during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential procedures .
headache , anxiety , difficult micro @-@ secre@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , diar@@ rhe@@ a , predic@@ tive pain , verti@@ go , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ illary stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human stem cells / bas@@ ket@@ ones as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including reinforcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling properties , determined by the swelling of the nose , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the treatment in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of in@@ a@@ emia in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four prob@@ ands of the lor@@ ry were poorly chel@@ ated .
a component interaction study indicates that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ X and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine following the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was to the exposure after administration of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional safety pad toxic@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the drug virus system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and wat@@ ery or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases with you under the application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • Hear@@ ing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nausea and head@@ aches , or strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
transport efficiency and the handling of machines If applied in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ ob@@ ols than you should notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the dose as soon as possible and use the next dose at the intended time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .

for children aged 1 to 5 , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by as@@ cer@@ taining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ri@@ lateral , sleep and performance in the day ) before and after a six @-@ week treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to a decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , a six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % of patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials to be effective in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current disease progress and can be terminated after the symptoms cease and resume when re@@ appearing .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during allergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the framework of clinical studies with Des@@ oxy@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that may cause impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg compared to those treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported side effects reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , oral dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches ; this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ oxy@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human stem cells / bas@@ ket@@ ones as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ oxy@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including reinforcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated on the basis of the total quality of the questionnaire regarding quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces stress caused by seasonal or allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as representative for other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
as hi@@ stam@@ ine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in addition to the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , leads to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of cords at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients with the general seasonal allergies of Rh@@ initi@@ s were similar , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was reached in 4 % of patients .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ oxy@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely ruled out .
in vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional safety pad toxic@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher level of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is met@@ aboli@@ zed in a limited way , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normal metabolism .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , consuming A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not enhanced by the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 , who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dosage of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily for more than 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ oxy@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not cause any impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ oric .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of alcohol @-@ induced power reduction nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated on the basis of the total quality of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduced the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of cords at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this constra@@ ined met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are met@@ aboli@@ zed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ X was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ oxy@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup is offered in type III bracket bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene seal with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

if the solution for inser@@ ting an application sy@@ ringe for preparations is added with sc@@ aling , you can use it as an alternative to take the appropriate amount of solution to take .
regarding the duration of treatment , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s under which you suffer and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia common side effects were frequent in adults fatigue , mouth @-@ dry and headache more often than with placebo reported .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for filing is available in bottles with child @-@ safe cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml packaging size is a measuring spoon or an application sp@@ lash of û@@ r preparations for inser@@ ting with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced that the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially announces that the company will withdraw its application for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have not yet built any immunity ( no protection ) .
after the vaccine is passed , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies in a contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane covering the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base did not suff@@ ice to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you wish further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swallow the capsules , ap@@ ri@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
ap@@ ri@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken .
for children between four and twelve years and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ap@@ ri@@ ase depends on body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduces the HIV mass in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
ap@@ ri@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the medicine , enhanced with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but a@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were only very few of the treatment .
in the study of adults who used to be treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the anti @-@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r strengthened the viral load as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 16 weeks of treatment :
in the patients with HIV resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who received their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of ap@@ ri@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to det@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
ap@@ ri@@ ase may also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are as well degra@@ ded as ap@@ ri@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ap@@ ri@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years were out@@ weighed against the risks in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
ap@@ ri@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefit of ap@@ ri@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing of ap@@ ri@@ ms across the European Union .
ap@@ ri@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ at@@ r should be administered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ at@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than the capsule ; therefore , ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
2 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of ap@@ ri@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ap@@ ri@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
ap@@ ri@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function distur@@ b@@ ance should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
ap@@ ri@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ a.@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that a@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy cannot cure the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with ap@@ ri@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of con@@ current anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant medical information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ap@@ ri@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
for patients taking this medicine at the same time , ap@@ ri@@ ase may be less effective because of decreased blood plasma quality ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ at@@ oma , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution for taking up , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
ap@@ ri@@ ase should be aver@@ aged 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases that were required medication that could be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. a higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
H@@ amm@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis .
in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) that leads to severe clinical condition or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is believed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Sub@@ strate with low therapeutic width ap@@ ri@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width ap@@ ri@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are predominantly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ atal , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the degra@@ ded plasma level through a dose rise of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the det@@ onation ar@@ rays are and , if possible , to check the viral load and de@@ compose the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ at@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ gn@@ z below ) .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ atal capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
doses of 600 mg of pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , confirming the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ men twice a day .
52 % decreased if Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice a day in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ atal ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to provide a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed observation , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination are not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in conjunction with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended because of the fantasy component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in that the proceeds of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
for this reason , in combination with am@@ pren@@ at@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adjustment is not required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ra@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ at@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of det@@ avi@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution must be advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine could be less effective because of the reduced or potentially sub@@ therapeutic plastic cruci@@ bles .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of pren@@ ra@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ atal and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with aspir@@ in , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ap@@ ri@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the blood levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or In@@ duc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions between them , if they are used together with ap@@ ri@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with ap@@ ri@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as ap@@ ri@@ ase as it may result in resor@@ ption of resor@@ ption .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme products ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ at@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma cruci@@ bles of am@@ pren@@ at@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ am@@ il , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ pren@@ at@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
the simultaneous consumption of ap@@ ri@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test persons , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous addition of ap@@ ri@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in the plasma level are expected at the same time as ap@@ ri@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ at@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic levels up to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , since plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be increased with simultaneous dosing of am@@ pren@@ at@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , ap@@ ri@@ ase may not be used together with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , whereas with simultaneous use of ap@@ ri@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ at@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ at@@ oma , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt the pren@@ ar dose when det@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended at the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the simultaneous administration of ap@@ ri@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ ri@@ mal rats , det@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was given away from the st@@ alli@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of the seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ atal to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of ap@@ ri@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
the side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , appeared early and rarely led to treatment failure .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gen@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of ap@@ ri@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators rather than in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ wn sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viruses not previously treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ at@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s showed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or spot@@ less nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with det@@ avi@@ avi@@ r had to be broken off .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time when an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) is initiated ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of ap@@ ri@@ ase twice a day together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed under al@@ im@@ ase treatment , were very common in patients who received ap@@ ri@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient may observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ atal in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ mine Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ atal is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells .
the link between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ ar against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral in@@ treated patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 trial , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

prototype @-@ based analyses based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of det@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ at@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / S / T , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ at@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to assess the activity of det@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ at@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies who market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to det@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ ra@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossi@@ ls of resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral in@@ treated patients ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of efficacy of ap@@ ri@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the PRO@@ 300@@ 17 trial , a random@@ ised open trial , in which adults treated with PI ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ av@@ dan@@ centr@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ standard threshold of 0.4 to 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , 152 of which were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day .
there was no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with ap@@ ri@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ checked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ says should be taken into account when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ ar is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
increase of 50@@ 8 % , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ ar 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
for this reason , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous consumption influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ at@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of unknown pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval dependent on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range from C@@ MA@@ X , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or create a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily pren@@ atal exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , ap@@ ri@@ ase solution and ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schemes lead to pren@@ atal plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas showed ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the orig@@ ination of the h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tics , showed little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of this findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
in clinical trials no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of ap@@ ri@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
studies of toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with det@@ avi@@ avi@@ r .
in case of systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure to people in therapeutic doses , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us jug@@ gling and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which indicate delayed development .
24 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of ap@@ ri@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
ap@@ ri@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ atal , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ atal capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ atal ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to provide a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed observation , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination are not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ra@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ at@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of pren@@ ra@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with aspir@@ in , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ bal@@ di pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ am@@ il can be increased by det@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test persons , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended at the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of orth@@ o @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ al ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by det@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was given away from ni@@ p@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of ap@@ ri@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient may observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ atal in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ mine Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ atal is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ checked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ says should be taken into account when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the underlying mechanism for the orig@@ ination of the h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical applications yiel@@ ded little evidence of the assumption of clinical relevance of this findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies of toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with det@@ avi@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that in young animals the metabolic path@@ ways are not fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) are not fully mature .
A@@ gen@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution was not yet occupied in patients with PI pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ at@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than the capsule ; therefore , ap@@ ri@@ ase capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ atal which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gen@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that ap@@ ri@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not result in a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ ri@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
ap@@ ri@@ ase should be cancelled in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ 49 related factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
H@@ amm@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ atal , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ atal capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous consumption of ap@@ ri@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to adverse events associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral injection of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is unknown . however , due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , it is not possible to apply the contained propylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ ri@@ mal rats , det@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was given away from the st@@ alli@@ zation in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of ap@@ ri@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gen@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ at@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early abor@@ tion of a promising 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ checked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ says should be taken into account when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large c@@ ous@@ se volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ at@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the application frequency and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • For acute nucle@@ i , it is to be applied three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of pause between treatment cycles .
the cream is thin layer before bed@@ time to apply thin to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( approximately 8 hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with wart in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo arm daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
• In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . in all four main studies , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic acute ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine is continued until all visible cow@@ ards have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflamm@@ ations occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection occurs in the treatment area .
if in follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated lesi@@ ons are only in@@ completely healed , another therapy should be initiated ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed in the clean@@ sed , infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed .
there should be a balance between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of your auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with one for circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ k@@ tur was observed .
in the case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied agents for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal region there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data indicates an increased rate of follow @-@ up reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine has shown less efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after conclusion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment interval of several days can be made .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there is currently no data available about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapeutic forms should be taken into consideration in the case of super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with rel@@ ap@@ sed and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs there is no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons have a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies there are no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been reached neither after one @-@ off nor after multiple topical application , no recommendation can be given to apply during the breast@@ feeding period .
the most common adverse events included and possibly or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the F@@ itting war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort in the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ al@@ om patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below .
the most common side effect , probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in this study , was a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream patients treated with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ ch@@ ori@@ ation / sc@@ aling ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies , five @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe formation of scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials to investigate the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral absorption of 200 m@@ g. of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , might lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or IV fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentration of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies were shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of the cow@@ ards in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment was clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
60 % of the patients who had treated I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od totally healed the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ es ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine at five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years indicate that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - lesi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or face .
the first @-@ year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
pa@@ edi@@ atric patients usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , Plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ ed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study of the der@@ mal application that was carried out for four months showed no similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with der@@ mal administration of three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for the human being is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● F@@ itting war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the gen@@ itali@@ a and anus ( anus ) - superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
if it remains untreated , it may lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - that is why early detection and treatment are important .
ac@@ tin@@ ent nucle@@ i are harsh areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to exposure to sunlight during their lifetime .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for the infection .
O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations earlier , please inform your doctor about this before you begin treatment . o Read your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o Do not use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream when the area to be treated is cured after previous medication or surgical treatment . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a .
in case of accidental contact the cream should be removed by rin@@ se with water . o Do not use more cream than your doctor has prescribed you . o Do not apply cream as your doctor has prescribed you . o Do not expose the treated place after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream with a mild soap and water .
as soon as the reactions have been clari@@ fied , you can continue the treatment . o Inform@@ ing your doctor if they do not have a normal blood image
if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties in the re@@ traction of the fores@@ kin can be expected .
do not use al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) .
taking other medications may have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle .
if you have intercourse during the infection with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream is following the sexual intercourse ( not before ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have been used recently , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , as it is not known whether i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od will transfer into breast milk .
the frequency and duration of the treatment varies from f@@ og@@ war@@ ts , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) .
apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin place with the cow@@ ards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you have to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
for 6 weeks , apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream 5 days a week consec@@ u@@ tively in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist / pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Al@@ dar@@ a Cream .
if your skin responds too strongly to treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a degra@@ ded number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infection ; it can cause you to develop a blue spot faster or cause fatigue .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
in addition , you can find it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
most of the time these are lighter skin reactions , which disappear within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed .
occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , loc@@ alisation , skin inc@@ ant@@ ation , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .
occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , s@@ wollen and scar@@ ring ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , nas@@ al nose , flu or flu @-@ like symptoms , depression , irrit@@ ation , acute ker@@ ato@@ sis , redness , facial swelling , ul@@ cers , lim@@ b pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme treatment in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re @-@ loading equipment , and the patients may require appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study primarily investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the concentrations of G@@ AG in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients less than five years are high blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of the lung function ) , speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed and where necessary updating this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. an approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme immun@@ otherapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect associated with in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion process ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored closely , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which rehabilitation centres are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related response must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , the risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided due to the theoretically increased risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ka ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related response , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular up@@ take of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not lead to direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were observed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly severe form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ve@@ al version within 3 months after the treatment was started . in the patients at the age of 5 , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ian version was usually taken within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature termination from the study ) 13 / 45 patients were not affected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ res@@ c@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it had never come to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ian .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which did not appear to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and is absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase III study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although recru@@ ited patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of the patients had a mean phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of treatment , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and vi@@ ability in the following table compared to the placebo group .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically in@@ significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ her@@ nia before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in view of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clinical significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with medium maturity ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ Sc@@ ore for this age group The younger patients with the severe form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle conc@@ entri@@ c form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe form @-@ form only limited or no progress in cognitive development could be detected .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks may represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional safety pad toxic@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in unique administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .
since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

the holder of the licensing agreement will complete the following program within the given time , the results of which form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this tab will provide longer @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ ir@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because it is possible to reduce the effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medications or have recently taken it , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to use and is intended for IV application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , gradually increases every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - unconditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial oils .
very common ( occurrence in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • P@@ ain pain • Skin rash • P@@ ain disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion point

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • first determine the number of water @-@ to @-@ th@@ inning penetration bottles according to body weight of each patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug for cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( cancer of cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( drug for vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood count changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active period in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s effects in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug for cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin out@@ lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time of A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months for doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparison medication .
September 2004 The European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with a 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ al@@ advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Gift as well as the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period and another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood type should be created before each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under recovery of the N@@ adi@@ r blood sample or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except for neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before the treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- or so@@ - continued occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above , there is an increased side effect risk in patients aged 65 years .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , exceeding the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - B@@ order and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( with liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone @-@ therapy and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the number of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis once again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , the number of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ cre@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was om@@ itted when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid con@@ current use of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for whom treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent before P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this compound was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible fo@@ aming of the reproductive capacity is by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn@@ s to obtain advice regarding the sperm preservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ances ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advisable , if high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ances ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to treatment , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
because no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b are available , the simultaneous use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed for pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and anti @-@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , unless strictly required and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of treatment to obtain advice regarding the lock @-@ retention .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 163 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the conden@@ sed results of three single P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ Mono@@ therapies , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in the al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population , since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and well pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests included .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the common c@@ is@@ pla@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC showed medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the effect of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment were similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination against gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.2 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Contin@@ ent Frequ@@ ency ; IT@@ T = Contin@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ zero limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin were less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , patients required the addition of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed administered as a mono@@ therapeutic agent were investigated in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be recovered intact within 24 hours of use .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1,8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , which had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , sti@@ cky changes were observed ( De@@ genetics ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ f@@ al epitheli@@ al tissue ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring reaches from color@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who are allergic to All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , whereby about a quarter of the fats being added to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence for the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ ory , fat @-@ induced nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be applied by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since or@@ list@@ at is resor@@ bed to only minimal , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Hyper@@ ensi@@ tivity against the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in • Treatment of chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Sti@@ ll Time ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low fat diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes is accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption possibly possible in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bar was observed .
for the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most of the patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the addition of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known side effects noted after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as indicated in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ passive properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect lies in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
in clinical studies , it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ische , fatty diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their basic weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo plus 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average LD@@ L cholesterol ratio was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( starting value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo plus 3.@@ 8 % ( starting value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist measurements , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value of 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable in 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ c and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal systematic re@@ absorbed dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 ) were identified , which represented approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety pad toxic@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular risk for humans .
drug vi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of the licensing agreement must ensure that the drug virus system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application procedure , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after treatment start , since at this time you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional conditions : • Beg@@ in for a few days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ induced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you to exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children in@@ accessible . • You may not use any medication after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cart@@ on . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .

Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ eme@@ tics ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information regarding the effects in this age group .
this means that the substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the severe trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd to appro@@ ve the transport of Alo@@ ha across the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ ha for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the thickness of the colon , patients with am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored closely after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable while offering Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to a further chem@@ o@@ therapeutic gift , Alo@@ xi will not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the following days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor @-@ directed activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous p@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences regarding the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were related to Alo@@ xi ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and administration reactions ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships to observe .
di@@ aly@@ sis studies have not been carried out because of large de@@ part@@ mental volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for Alo@@ e over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) received at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ron , and 250 or 750 mc@@ g. of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of pal@@ p@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy people and cancer patients .
according to IV administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once a once @-@ daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to three consecutive days , the overall texture ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to that measured after one @-@ off intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ X was higher following the dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was re@@ discovered within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous captive bolt injection in healthy eyes , the total length of the body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation Ord@@ in@@ ance and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block i@@ onic channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met roughly 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , given daily for over two years , led to increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ma ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans .
the holder of this permit for placing an order must inform the European Commission about the plans for the placing of the drug approved as part of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the failure of the authorization for the marketing of the medicines provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refer@@ ral medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage causes damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in amine otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data proving the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
furthermore , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drugs to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease increased again in more patients than in the reference drug , and Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to assess the extent to which the medi@@ cam@@ ent forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) are not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( a skin infection with a crust ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ic Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo discussed treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ med cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the surface of the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or stit@@ ched wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is thoroughly wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
it should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected spot occurs after a 2 or 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ os@@ am@@ ic@@ in@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on a weakened skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant escap@@ ement in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ X increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on a dimin@@ ished skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ os@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment should be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , the benefit of breast@@ feeding should be weighed for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the site of administration which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
effect of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated through fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ an@@ tag@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding points of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
due to binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the transfer of pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block of P @-@ binding inter @-@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should counselling by experts should be sought due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at at least some infection forms , a consultation should be aimed at by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of a non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine was performed daily in oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secon@@ dar@@ ily traum@@ atic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was medi@@ ated primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under the low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid disease .
in @-@ vitro analysis for gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in the cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats micro@@ kernel for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were no signs of reduced fertility in male nor female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which resulted in a reduction of up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity have been detected .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ambient Memory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used as part of a two @-@ stage vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vaccine existing from two doses can be brought to an end .
if a ref@@ res@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambient rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin V@@ acc@@ ine approved since 1996 and the V@@ acc@@ ine of Twin@@ et admitted since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ matrix adults and Twin@@ matrix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ matrix adult contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ matrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody @-@ concentration a month after the last inj@@ ections .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
with 98 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix showed a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody levels against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ ence was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ enta ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain in the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is given .
if a ref@@ res@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated using the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hepatitis C antibodies ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have approached hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need a ref@@ res@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection drugs , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the combination vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after the imm@@ uni@@ zation process , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ ab@@ le@@ ction , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in cases of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or coag@@ ulation disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration to bleeding .
when ambient matrix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mass m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier Thi@@ om@@ ery and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ ence was compared to that of the three @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ eness on a calculation base per vacc@@ dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ enta at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of the three @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the participants who had given Ambi@@ ence had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle in 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects receiving Ambi@@ ence , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the three @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ality was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA units of form al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ e@@ rix a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose V@@ acc@@ ine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted with vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered by the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted between 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with ambi@@ e@@ rix .
the immun@@ ological responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with ambi@@ e@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA units of form al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be demonstrated for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that , which after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was detected in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the ref@@ res@@ ection of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum rates similar to previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be investigated both before and after the res@@ us@@ ment for possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
pursuant to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for that purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stuff and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not completely protect from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been concluded with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B Virus before administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix is ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the vacc@@ ination point ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to ambient lip@@ ase or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath , swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly protect against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually prescribed dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ e@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ enta is inj@@ ected to individuals suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient Assi@@ sted may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to the vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Sa@@ y your doctor if you / your child take other medications ( including those you can get without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated and / or has been given an immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibody ) or has been planned in the near future .
however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with ambition , there should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , ambi@@ ti@@ rix is not given pregnant or nursing women unless it is urgent that they will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
please inform your doctor if you / your child have shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the stit@@ ch or redness • Mat@@ ter • irrit@@ ability • headache • A lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
other side effects that have been reported very rarely days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 contaminated doses ) are :
these include loc@@ aly limited or extensive strokes , which may be it@@ chy or pu@@ ff @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyes and face , swelling or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood and un@@ consciousness .

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package insert .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ence remains positive .
however , since ambi@@ rix has been put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug are limited due to low patient expos@@ ures .
am@@ mount can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mount is - split up to several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose tube ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ y could not be compared to another treatment or placebo ( a false medicine , that is , without active ingredient ) .
am@@ mount can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mount in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mount was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this medicine was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete lack of enzyme already in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ fol@@ ated form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ fests after the first month of life ) , an indication for use occurs when hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early mani@@ manifest deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine o@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
ar@@ gin@@ ine should receive a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day with ar@@ gin@@ ine @-@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of the formation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and e@@ dem@@ a .
since met@@ aboli@@ zation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at are carried out via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesi@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
in the case of an over@@ dose , a 5 @-@ month old child with an in@@ adver@@ tent dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) occurred .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity with intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
as a matter of fact , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers to ex@@ cre@@ ase excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of di@@ gest@@ ed sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ fol@@ ate form of the disease with the onset of early symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analogue within the first year of life .
due to ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ian en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ stage form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the ni@@ pple trans@@ lu@@ or@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and a further worsen@@ ing of neurological condition may occur in some patients .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is contained in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic glut@@ amine , producing phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after giving a single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) the next morning , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in the morning after night fasting .
in three out of six patients treated with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no compla@@ ined effects in the case of toxic and non @-@ toxic dos@@ ages ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can still not swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ a cord or a nose probe .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early mani@@ manifest deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine o@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before birth , there were lesi@@ ons in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
suscep@@ ti@@ bility to interference : phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers to ex@@ cre@@ ase excess nutrients .
on the basis of research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , we can assume that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at has been produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment , and a further worsen@@ ing of neurological condition may occur in some patients .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ulate form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
during shelf life , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
the small measuring spoon is 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , fla@@ vor@@ ings , impaired hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory defic@@ its and worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions were also observed .
if you find one of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room at your hospital for the treatment of appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood type ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , headache , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , uncomfortable skin smell , rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; standing up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measuring value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in combination with a Gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti @-@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during PCI , the patient was often used as a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , Angi@@ ox - with or without Gift of GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year overall just as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox was just as effective in all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any other components .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the transport of angi@@ ox@@ in across the European Union .
for treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ) inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is subsequently performed , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
just before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single retinal detachment of angi@@ ox@@ ins has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to use and the bol@@ us dose should be administered quickly intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which may be PCI ( whether treated with ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT level is 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is checked again 5 minutes after the second round of the bolt .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which was included in the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the biop@@ sy was administered without dose adjustment , with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the IV administration of frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe ren@@ al damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ vali@@ er is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in case of PCI @-@ patients the majority of blood cl@@ ots occur at arter@@ ial points of point , patients with a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ er once again reaches the pre @-@ treatment level .
based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ating inhibit@@ ors ) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are to be monitored regularly .
in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , band@@ aging or post@@ nat@@ al development , the animal @-@ experimental studies are inadequate ( see Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ fac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine group as well as in the treatment groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding , as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among Bi@@ vali@@ er than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ tra @-@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area that required radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasional ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with a Bi@@ vali@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine group and in the treatment groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common among Bi@@ vali@@ er than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are summ@@ ar@@ ised in table 6 according to system organ classes .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ din is to be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ meri@@ zed with regard to the signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on ind@@ entation region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine to thro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , there was no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) to indu@@ ce thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate reaction in the past .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ a shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was subsequently performed , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ er should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ fac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and 1 @-@ year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients receiving aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information about the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ dor@@ ine were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ er as pep@@ tide goes through cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ distribution of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the split of AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes needing treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or unable to process insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active duration than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 grown @-@ ups .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration fell 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components or patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that may affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the upper th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal bell .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the active force , the brand ( her@@ - iter ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in the need for insulin .
3 An insufficient dose or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with an insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the change of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in dosage necessary .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change if the treatment schem@@ as change .
the substances which increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amid , fi@@ br@@ ate , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , post@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics , such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pine , can be allevi@@ ated or missing the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ gene regulation .
animal experimental studies for reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins enter human breast milk , but generally insulin is not absorbed into breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .
the following are listed in clinical trials , which are known from clinical trials , grouped according to system organic classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive strain , head@@ aches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If the injection point within the injection region is continuously changed , a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose administration by a doctor .
after glu@@ cos@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ - cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose up@@ take ( in particular through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as through the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mil@@ lim@@ - tus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glu@@ cos@@ a @-@ reducing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cor@@ tical effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that a similar post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
became insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ o@@ ves prior to the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in administered in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal mal@@ functioning , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
