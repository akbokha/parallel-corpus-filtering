<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Opinion Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Wiring thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar disorder, a mental disorder where patients alternate with periods of abnormal mood (periods of anorexia).</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for treating moderate to severe manic episodes and prophylactic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used to quickly control increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both diseases, the solution may be applied to inhale or the enamel tablets in patients who difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other drugs at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably appears primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree as the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripichatel contributes to normalizing brain activity, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing reappearing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol in another study comparing the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence to 160 patients with whom the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased restlessness, compared to the Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify reduced clinical symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the reoccurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled Zucken), Tremor (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, nausea, fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to treatment with aripitizol against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if an oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be taken into account when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripidosis dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiguzol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of suicidal risk with aripidosis in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaic heart disease, heart failure, overconduction), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celerated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, occasional reports about dyskinesia occur during treatment with aripidosis.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be taken into consideration, reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, have to be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiguzol in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events occurred in patients treated with aripidosis.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma, or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycaemia related adverse events involving Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuremia, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, care must be taken care of when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of aripidosis, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial involving healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of aripitizol by 107% while the CMAX remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="52">In case of CYP2D6 'poor' (= poor 'poor') metabolization, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiotl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level before the start of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be used with a moderate increase in aripianism concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of aria per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethacrylate / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethacrylate).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and the concerns generated in reproductive studies for animals, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with aria prazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from aria prazema and 13.1% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with aripipole was 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients suffering from aria prazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients suffering from aria prazema treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from aria treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of the CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with aria-treated patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, as reported in the treatment with Aripiguzol, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and convulsions, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdoses with aripitizol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripidosis; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of aripiboliole in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine d2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is imparted.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripibol showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a and a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at Nucleus caudatus and at putative.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripibol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of responder patients who attended the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripitizol 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significant reduction in the rate of relapse, which was at 34% in the Aripibol group and 57% below placebo, showed a significantly higher rate of response.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, Aripivotzol showed a placebo superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, Aripianism did not show superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripianism showed a versus placebo-superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12 Aripibol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features that did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with aripibol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiguzol during a stabilization period before randomization, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyfication of aripitizol, the N-Dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean time of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripivda for extensive metabolisers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor 'poor' (= poor 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiguzol there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as with a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenia patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A stimulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in respect of ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripitizol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydrotene were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on liver function on the pharmacokinetics of aripibol and dehydro aripidosis, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional safety pad toxicology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data showed no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no importance for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included dose-dependent secondary kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of the sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile of apes after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans (based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the bile of apes, and are well below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3- and 11-fold of the middle-grade steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dosage.</seg>

<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of aripiguzol injection solution in patients suffering from agitism and behavioural disorders that were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">In case a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with respect to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of aripiotl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaic heart disease, heart failure, overconduction), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celerated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, occasional reports about dyskinesia occur during treatment with aripidosis.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of mns are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and irregular heartbeat).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuremia, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedative was higher compared to the after sole administration of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was used intramuscularly and concurrently received lauazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of aripidosis, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In the case of CYP2D6 'poor' (= poor 'poor') metabolizing, the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripipic acid compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can can be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level before the start of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedative was greater compared to the after sole administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials using Aripivated injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were considered to be possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from aria treatment and 13.1% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients suffering from aria prazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from aria prazole and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with aria-treated patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, as reported in the treatment with Aripiguzol, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and convulsions, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the aripiroole injection solution with statistically significant greater improvements of agility / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder, as well as aggrading and behavioural disorders, the aripitizol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms of toxicity and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from baseline at the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5,8 for Placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiguzol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar effectiveness in relation to the overall population was observed, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of responder patients who attended the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripitizol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher response rate was shown for Aripiprazole (oral), which was at 34% in the Aripiguzol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features, which were sometimes not related to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, companion therapy with aripipole resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiguzol during a stabilization period before randomization, Aripibol showed herself superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC is 90% larger the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablets; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time up to reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration after repeated administration of systemic exposure (AUC), which were intramuscular over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg. respectively.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application, no safety-related concerns were observed after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with aripiprazole (oral) for safety pad toxicology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore they have only limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included dose-dependent secondary kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in people.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of the sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from apes to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans (based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated, of which about three quarters had previously received anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in combination with chemotherapy or as monotherapy) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only those patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time, there was no difference between the efficacy indicators like time to the worsening of disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer, these indicators showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It should also not be applied to patients who have low neutral number of neutrophils before the treatment starts.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was no longer, more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other paclitaxel chemotherapy drugs, it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">January 2008 The European Commission issued a licence to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the placing of Abraxanes throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first-line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anthracycline-based therapy is not shown (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neuropenia (neutrophils of &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during abrasion therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3, treatment is to interrupt until an improvement is achieved to degree 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles, the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data to safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound Nano-articulated formulation of paclitaxel, which could have considerably different pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophils has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thrombocytes increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with abrasives.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity has not been proven, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual anti-emetics and constipating methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used for pregnant women or women in childbearing age, which are not effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised about a sperm preservation prior to treatment, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (frequently) that can affect the perversion and ability to handle machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most noticeable hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was in three cases severe (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphor in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, back pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, chest pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscular weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and there was no causal connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-prescription medication that promotes the aggregation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their dependency.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendoomsal transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminreeptor and, due to the albuminal protein SPARC (sected protein acidic line in cysteine), appears to be an accumulation of paclitaxel in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two approved unincorporated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel alone, either in the form of a solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a reduced general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastatic disease and 19% for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time until progression of disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line treatment are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound on baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel according to 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active ingredient exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravasculular distribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane administration (43%) than with a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of the human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily with 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urination of the unchanged drug with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel resulted in a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and above light light for more than 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "referral medicine").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood protein values that might occur in connection with blood transfusion complications, if a blood donation is not possible before the intervention, and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml may be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be performed by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have given appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be controlled prior to treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by a erythropoietindeficiency, or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which empowers it to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Absenamed was compared to intravenous injections in a vein as part of a primary study involving 479 patients who suffered anaemia due to kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to either Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the start of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study where the effects of Abseamed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were placed on Abseamed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally leads to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Iris amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations, evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures Abseamed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG, a permit for the placing of Abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, preexisting anaemia at the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger operating procedures demanding a large volume of blood for women; 5 or more units of blood in men.</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a major electrical orthopaedic operation in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>

<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except in paediatric patients where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Initial symptoms and results may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease burden; therefore, the doctor's evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control anemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week via IV application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Initial symptoms and - consequent effects may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the doctor's evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for controlling the initial symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the repeat cyte quantity for ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the repeat number of &lt; 40.000 cells / µl have risen relative to baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after a further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the repeat cyte quantity for ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be retained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) resp. the repeat cyte quantity increased by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the start of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa should preoperatively be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection may be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from an erythroblastie (Pure Red Cell Achisia, PRCA) should not receive either Abseamed or any other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - Erythroblastoenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. amnestically known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who cannot participate in an autologous donor program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disorder; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastie (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl a month) with increased need for transfusions, the etiology value should be determined and the usual causes of failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum toxicity, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the adenulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the repeat cyte index), is low (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte figures are normal, and if no other reason for loss of action is found, the anti-erythropoetin-antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating active substances (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the administration of epoetines if the concentration of haemoglobin is increased beyond the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically vident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-dose and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a b-value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the use of recombinant erythropoieine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia is examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a greater elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially for an underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial value of &gt; 13 g / dl an elevated risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy returned when a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7,5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was aspired</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro examinations on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of interactions between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarcts, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysm, retinal thromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovvascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoietin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The most technologically recovered epoetin alfa is glycosified and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate content with the endogenous erythropoetin that has been isolated from the urine of anaesthetic patients.</seg>

<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of the patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to zoledroneic acid or other bisphosphonate or other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney ailments, reactions to the infusion and osteonecrose (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides reconnaissance material for doctors who prescribe acetylation for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains instructions on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">Following a treatment by the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>

<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a Creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and teenagers Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, because data on safety and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with the intake of calcium and vitamin D before the onset of treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of zoledroneic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia develops, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, respectively twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="615">In the study to prevent clinical fractures after a recently suffered hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of Zoledroneic acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the orthodontic area, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primary in the jaw area), were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledroneic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients performed Osteonecrose in the orthodontic area in a patient treated with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of an overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an IV infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated with either a bone density filter (BMD) -T-score for the femoral neck ≤ -1.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric level fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk for hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on the lumbar vertebrate, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatments significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the femal neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology At 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies from the pelvic stem were taken one year after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">Microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume compared to placebo in patients with Aclasta versus placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone reconstruction markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dosage of Aclasta reduced significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>

<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effects on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, in comparison to placebo treatment, the BMD increased the total dose and femoral neck at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">More than 24 months compared to placebo treatments, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total fractures and 4.3% on the femoral neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients, the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a decrease in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in the placebo-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308) the once annual administration of acetostin was not inferior to the one-week administration of alendronat based on the percentage change in lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 with radiologically confirmed, above all light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with 2.6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of citric acid compared to taking 30 mg of Risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain and pain influence after 6 months in comparison with the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month trial were included in the follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From 143 with aclasta and 107 with Risedronate treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response could be maintained with 141 of patients treated with acetylate, compared to 71 of patients treated with Risedronate, for an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledroneic acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Afterwards the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large circulatory cycle with half-life cycles t ½ α0,24 and t ½ β is 1.87 hours followed by a long phase of elimination with a terminal eliminations calf's time t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent rapid resorption in bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance amounts irrespective of the dose 5.04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of mettochromium-P450 enzyme systems metabolized substances is unlikely because Zoledroneic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Creatinin Clearance, and in 64 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">The result is that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disturbance down to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the citric acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">There are no statements for this population because of severe kidney dysfunction (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">Studies on dogs allowed single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC, 6 times the recommended humane-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledroneic acid was administered in rats at a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 6x of the human therapeutic exposure related to the AUC, corresponding to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and the intravenous injection point occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common complication in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysise of long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiabsorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">At rats, one observed a teratogenicity in dosages starting from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Opinion Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, causing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional injection of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and sulfonyanine in a lowering of HbA1c values was 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who received Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were blurred vision, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypothesize (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Actos across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attacks or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated initial liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzyme values will be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient continues with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical appraisal up to the preliminary examination of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven, which can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A minor reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred as a result of hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2%) and hematokrits by 1-3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two-cavity or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonyl resin or as two-person combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with thiazoldindions, including pioglitazone, was reported on the occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the incidence of macular edema, but prescription doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes for a pregnancy or this occurs, treatment should be cancelled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies to investigate the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not exercise relevant effects on pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical codynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs, which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction in hyperinsulin resistance caused by pregnant women and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by treatment with pioglitazone, thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown.</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary alteration of the tower and refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon ALT-climbs quadruple the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if Pioglitazon or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazon, more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in groups treated with comparators.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study running over a period of 3.5 years, Fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have activated the activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome proliferation activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued for over two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of treatment, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients suffering from pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients showed a continuous statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week examination of type 2 diabetes patients.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as minor, but clinically insignificant elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, a statistically significant increase of LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while lower scores were observed under metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease were randomized into groups who received in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment of either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it was demonstrated that Pioglitazon does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, plasma volume enlarging with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentricity hypertrophie occurred in mice, rats, dogs and apes.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduced susceptibility of hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal in the treatment with pioglitazone, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), the rat induced higher incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazoldindiones resulted in increased frequency of colonospores.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years, the effects of combination therapy of metformin were examined with pioglitazone or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients showed consistently a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial triglyceride level, both through an effect on tryglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride level.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revitalization and secularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone is not associated with cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="886">However, hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycaemia can be treated by the oral supplementation of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juices. • Serious hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by means of a proven help person or by glucose, administered intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total length of time is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>

<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the beginning of the Febuxostattreatment and in the further course, according to clinical findings (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwar did not conduct any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-hibition could lead to an increase in theophylline (a inhibit of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 2 x was associated with an increase in the exposure of Febuxostat and naproxen (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>

<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily demonstrated an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an antacids that contains magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in the CMAX by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancy may not include side effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the serum harnage level was reduced to &lt; 357 µmol / l (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed a treatment against a disease in the months of 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against gushing).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout bone, which in 54% of the patients had a complete disappearance of the nodes until month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased SHE values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAX) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat increased by dose of simple and multiple doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportionately.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For febuxostat doses between 120 mg and 300 mg there is an increase in AUC higher than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day, the CMAX is about 2.8-3,2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking a 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, about 49% of the dose in the urine was found as an immutable Febuxostat (3%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (30%), whose known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found as an immutable Febuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and as further unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups renal insufficiency following ingesting multiple doses of 80mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency did not change the CMAx of Febuxostat in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not lie down to the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company submitted data that stem from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in regards to increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the share of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those treated with alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE exactly matches the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), ulcers (ulcera), ulcers, ulcers (bloated abdomen), fever blisters.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with hypersensitivity to Alendronate, vitamin D3 or any other components, ADROVANCE must not be used.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow the instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• During the day, ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • Patients should not chew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except for pyloroplasty, are given only with special care (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients while taking alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor is therefore advised to draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out, in the occurrence of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain during swallowing or retroviral pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine and obtain medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious esophageal side-effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronat no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenalulcera, among them some severe and complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteon rose of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regimen administered intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>

<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately addressed before the start of treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronate was taken in clinical trials in conjunction with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines, without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for postmenopausal women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or nursing women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a year of treatment (e.g. examining how often a new organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">Furthermore, shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Advocate is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events, including immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changeovers of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">Following a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advocate should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After moving from Prograf to Advocate, the tacrolimus levels should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the tacrolimus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advantee to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a low clearance substance, an adjustment of the lawyer can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application For suppression of graft rejection must be maintained by immunosuppression; consequently, maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advant therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments can later be required, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change after the transplant in the course of the patient's stabilization.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advant therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advocate must be converted a graft receiver of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advantee, so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressiva to agraf once a day, treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin for the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are converted to agraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there are no clinical experience with advanes-, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, occurred in a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with pankreasttransplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level, a calculation of creatinine and supervision of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advocate when migrating from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the blood level in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical appraisal of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case by means of full blood-blood-tacrolimus-tallow controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the tacrolimus tallow during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to agraph, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advocate is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments can take several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley mirror of Tacrolimus is usually in the blood during the first time after liver transplants in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with nag and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance treatment of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur in a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dose; changeovers of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the Salardierte formulation Advantee.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In addition to prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, there are still no clinical data for the Salardierte formulation Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a lowering of the tacrolimusculature in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during a treatment with a lawyer (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is advisable, as the tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases Prograf used to observe a chamber or septic hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy which can therefore also occur under Advocate agraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, overloading and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective shield with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who use tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, cramps and blurred vision, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus increase or lower the blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the tacrolimus- blood level with the simultaneous addition of substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintaining even concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinct interaction was associated with anti-boycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macroeyelid antibiotic Erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the elevated oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of the gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as the CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus reduces the clearances of steroid contraceptives and thus can increase hormonal exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially lessen the clearances of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were changed from tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Horacic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases where there was no acute transplant rejection was higher after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) for transplant transplant patients in the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematocrit value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the deficiency of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advocates are used for the treatment of bleeding or preventing bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency, causing blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union, called Recombinate, but is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood vessels with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosing The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and the extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma level (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, a reasonable determination of the factor VIII-plasma level is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor of VIII plasma activities is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to prove a inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosing speed should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-titrated) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs experienced in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of Factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of inhibitors formation, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the coagulation factor VIII-mirror occurred in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion (10 - 14 postoperative day).</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VIII- Mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clearance rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE, 145 children and adults 2 with severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 days of exposure with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, a FVIII inhibitor was observed in none of the 53 paediatric patients aged under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) following previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial were 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the occurrence of Urticaria, Pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophile granulocytes was reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) officially announces that the company will withdraw its application for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni's cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, bones or soft tissues (tissues that connect, surrounds and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically altered to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a Adenovirus, which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin should have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene, which is not defective in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill cells when DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient representing Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the lower abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the answers of the company to the questions presented to him, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the inspection of the documents initially submitted, the CHMP will draw up a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not proven that the injections of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advancin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the return consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "altered drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by an allergy to pollen caused inflammation of the nose-ways) in patients with nasal mucous membranes (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is a tablet twice a day, which should be taken with or without food by a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effect measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received Aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patient under aerosaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), oral dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeronaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to Desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active agents or lauatadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeronaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow-angle glaucoma (elevated blood pressure), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrooia (hyperthyrointestinal function) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aeronaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), aeronaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms cease.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with Desloratadin as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity of combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, lulydroergotamine or other deongestives that are applied perorally or nasally as abnormal rhinoceroses (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphaolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy has not been checked for this patient population and the data is insufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerosaze have not been checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to pronounce the dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or amplification of the headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck, or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aeronaze is to be deprecated at least 48 hours prior to the performance of dermatological tests, since antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with Desoxyatadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were given additionally, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadin and those treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not Desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desoxyatadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerobols during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerobaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness that can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible sequential procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult micro-secretion, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, diarrhea, predictive pain, vertigo, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly probable in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, pupillary stiffness and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human stem cells / basketones as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the total scores for the symptoms (except nasal mucous swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerobaze tablets with regard to the swelling properties, determined by the swelling of the nose, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the treatment in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of inaemia in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the body weight of the loratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects, it was found that four probands of the lorry were poorly chelated.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study indicates that exposure (CMAX and AUC) of pseudoephedrine following the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to the exposure after administration of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional safety pad toxicology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, for genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadin cannot detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of lauatadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The drug virus system described in Module 1.8.1 of the application application is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerobaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and watery or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases with you under the application of aerobaze: • hypertension • Hearing, palpitations • cardiac arrhythmias • nausea and headaches, or strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Transport efficiency and the handling of machines If applied in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerobaze leads to dizziness or reduces the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerobols than you should notify your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerobaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take a dose of Aerinaze, if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the dose as soon as possible and use the next dose at the intended time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Chasing, restlessness with increased physical activity, oral dry, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in the urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness and dizziness.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desoxyatadin, cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breath, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rash were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart-hunting, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, insomnia, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspicuous liver values has also been very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lyophilisate for taking (soluble tablets), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged 1 to 5, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by ascertaining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrilateral, sleep and performance in the day) before and after a six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution for taking and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32% compared to a decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria, a six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Loratadin, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials to be effective in the use of Desloratadin in young people aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current disease progress and can be terminated after the symptoms cease and resume when reappearing.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during allergy time.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in the framework of clinical studies with Desoxyatadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness that may cause impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported daily in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported side effects reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), oral dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches; this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with Desoxyatadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multidose study, at which up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human stem cells / basketones as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg. a day in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which Desoxyatadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the neunfold of the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated on the basis of the total quality of the questionnaire regarding quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces stress caused by seasonal or allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic Urticaria was investigated as representative for other forms of Urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine is a causative factor in all urinary diseases, it is expected that Desloratadin, in addition to the chronically idiopathic urticaria, leads to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of cords at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>

<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of apriase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">"" "in combination with other antiviral medicines," "" "Agenase" "" "reduces the HIV mass in the blood and keeps it at a low level." ""</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Apriase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The medicine, enhanced with low doses of ritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the modification of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who were treated with protease inhibitors were only very few of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults who used to be treated with protease inhibitors, the anti-ritonavir strengthened the viral load as effectively as other protease inhibitors after 16 weeks of treatment:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV resistant to four other protease inhibitors, there was a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who received their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of apriase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to detonavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Apriase may also not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are as well degraded as apriase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipoystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteonecrose (death of bone tissue) or an immune response syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of apriase in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years were outweighed against the risks in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Apriase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier ritonavir, but the committee stated that the benefit of apriase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the placing of aprims across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Apriase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, apriase capsules for the pharmacokinetic booster of amprenatr should be administered together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenatavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenatr as a solution to intake is 14% less than the capsule; therefore, apriase capsules and solution are not exchangeable on one milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for apriase capsules is 600 mg of prenatavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily combined with other antiretroviral medications.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If asgenerase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (Boosters), higher doses of apriase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for apriase capsules is 20 mg of prenatavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to a daily dose of 2400 mg of prenatavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of apriase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Apriase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of apriase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disturbance should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Apriase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprena.r (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy cannot cure the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with apriase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, apriase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of concurrent antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant medical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of apriase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients taking this medicine at the same time, apriase may be less effective because of decreased blood plasma quality (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenatavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opatoma, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenase solution for taking up, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Apriase should be averaged 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were required medication that could be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. a higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer-lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Hammophile patients (Type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors are reports of an increase in hemorrhages including haematoma and hemothrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In the case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) that leads to severe clinical condition or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is believed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol intake, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 Substrate with low therapeutic width apriase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width apriase with Ritonavir must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are predominantly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenatal, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the degraded plasma level through a dose rise of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenatr can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the detonation arrays are and, if possible, to check the viral load and decompose the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nelfinavir is administered together with amprenatr (see also Efavignz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">By contrast, 508% is reduced by 30% for CMAX if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenatal capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">Doses of 600 mg of prenatavir were twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, confirming the efficacy and safety of this treatment regimen twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% decreased if Amprenatr (750 mg twice daily) was administered twice a day in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenatr in plasma, which were achieved twice a day in the combination of Amprenatal (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenatr and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended to provide a close-meshed observation, as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination are not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in conjunction with Didanosin, but it is recommended because of the fantasy component of Didanosin that the proceeds of didanosine and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, in combination with amprenatr (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efaviraz in combination with amprenatr and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggests that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of detaviavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution must be advised as Delavirine could be less effective because of the reduced or potentially subtherapeutic plastic crucibles.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of prenrar and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenatal and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with aspirin, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with apriase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the blood levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenar and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and AUC (0-τ) once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenatavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or Inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions between them, if they are used together with apriase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with apriase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as apriase as it may result in resorption of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-convulants known as enzyme products (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenatr can lead to a degradation of the plasma crucibles of amprenatr.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, nivamil, nifedipine, nimodipine, nivamil can be increased 10 by amprenatr, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous consumption of apriase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensify with PDE5 inhibitors associated side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test persons, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous addition of apriase with Ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In the case of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in the plasma level are expected at the same time as apriase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with amprenatr.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic levels up to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, since plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus may be increased with simultaneous dosing of amprenatr (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, apriase may not be used together with Midazolam (see Section 4.3), whereas with simultaneous use of apriase with parenteral Midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenatr, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opatoma, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt the prenar dose when detonavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended at the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of pritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the simultaneous administration of apriase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lacrimal rats, detonavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether prenatavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was given away from the stalliation into the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Amprenatal to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of apriase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">The side effects associated with the Agenase treatment were mild to moderate, appeared early and rarely led to treatment failure.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with taking Agenase or another medicine used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of apriase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators rather than in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipoystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fawn subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation (Stiernacken).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviruses not previously treated persons treated with amprenatr in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernacken) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, patients treated at 245 NRTIs showed 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or spotless nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with detaviavir had to be broken off.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In the case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time when an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) is initiated (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In case of PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of apriase twice a day together with low dose kritonavir (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed under alimase treatment, were very common in patients who received apriase together with low dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient may observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenatr binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein levels with the consequence of an education without infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenatal in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmine Concentration (IC50) of Amprenatal is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in the case of chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The link between the activity of Amprenar against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenatavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir-based regimens with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral intreated patients receiving 700mg of Fosamprenar with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 trial, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 trial and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenatr / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors entered patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Prototype-based analyses based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of detavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenatr / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenatavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations L10F / I, L33F, M36I, I54A / L / S / T, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenatr with Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to assess the activity of detavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenatr / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies who market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypical Cut-offs for FPV / RTV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to detonavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenrar and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fossils of resistance trails, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral intreated patients (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against Tidenavir), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenatr maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations, which may adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of efficacy of apriase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the PRO30017 trial, a randomised open trial, in which adults treated with PI (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleavdancentra (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the substudy A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-standard threshold of 0.4 to 10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asgenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, 152 of which were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was tested twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with apriase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of" "" "unchecked" "" "assays should be taken into account when optimizing the therapy with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenar is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">Increase of 508%, by 30% for CMAX, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenatr (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of prenatavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenar 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">For this reason, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous consumption influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amprenatr from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unknown prenatavir, which represents the active part, remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenatavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval dependent on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Steady State over the range from CMAX, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or create a substrate of CYP3A4 should be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with asgenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of apriase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, results in a similar daily prenatal exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Prenatavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, apriase solution and apriase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram-basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction on the elimination of amprenatavir and Ritonavir should be low.</seg>

<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test persons, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">Increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended at the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of ortho-novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindral) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin by detavir by 22% or respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions normally decrease in intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 lesions have a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with care in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies there are no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, binding or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have been reached neither after one-off nor after multiple topical application, no recommendation can be given to apply during the breastfeeding period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common adverse events included and possibly or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod cream related side effects in trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the Fitting warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream related side effects include discomfort in the application site with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basalom patients treated by 185 with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common side effect, probably or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod cream in connection with the application of the Imiquimod cream in this study, was a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical studies of phase III with Imiquimod-cream patients treated with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), exchoriation / scaling (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan, the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies, five-week treatment with Imiquimod cream is very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe formation of scarring (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials to investigate the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg. of imiquimiodine, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, might lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hypotonia that normalized after oral or IV fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, increasing systemic concentration of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies were shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of the cowards in an Imiquimod treatment was clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of the patients who had treated Imiquimod totally healed the Feignies; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing was achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Efficacy of Imiquimiodine at five-time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary supernatural basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years indicate that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertrophic ac- lesions within a related 25 cm2 treatment area on the hairless scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The first-year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">Paediatric patients usually do not appear in paediatric patients and therefore have not been examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, Placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrued 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life of the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or supernormal basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study of the dermal application that was carried out for four months showed no similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with dermal administration of three days a week did not induce tumours in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for the human being is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the enzyme treatment in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased pulmonary volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with re-loading equipment, and the patients may require appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study primarily investigates the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its effectiveness (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyme lowered the concentrations of GAG in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients less than five years are high blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of the lung function), speedycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be highly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be disclosed and where necessary updating this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. an approval for the transport of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme immunotherapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerates this, can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect associated with infusion or until the end of the infusion process (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored closely, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which rehabilitation centres are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase-3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related response must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience regarding resumption of treatment after a longer break, the risk of an oversensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously avoided due to the theoretically increased risk of an oversensitivity reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretika), to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related response, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular uptake of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not lead to direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over mother's milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as infusion-related responses, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme were observed in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with predominantly severe form and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated with a seroconveal version within 3 months after the treatment was started. in the patients at the age of 5, a seroconian version was usually taken within one month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature termination from the study) 13 / 45 patients were not affected by radioimmunoprescitation (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it had never come to Seroconian.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which did not appear to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation sufficient recovery of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the cycle and is absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme was studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although recruited patients were recruited for the study, the majority of the patients had a mean phenotype and only one patient referred to the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme each week (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of treatment, the patients treated with Alduracyme showed an improvement in lung function and viability in the following table compared to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically insignificant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hephernia before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of GAG mirrors in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In view of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clinical significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FEV, distance in 6-minute walk, range of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe follow-up form and 4 with medium maturity).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirrors in Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle concentric form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe form-form only limited or no progress in cognitive development could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks may represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Alduracyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • first determine the number of water-to-thinning penetration bottles according to body weight of each patient.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug for cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (cancer of cancer), and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "antiemetics" (drug for vomiting) and liquids should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin (to prevent fluid deficiency) before or after the administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood count changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed thus slows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active period in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, Alimta's effects in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug for cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin outlived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time of Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months for docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta showed longer survival times than with the comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">September 2004 The European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to approve the transport of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a 25 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with localadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominant plate-epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is given intravenous infusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed Gift as well as the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose Pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period and another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood type should be created before each application, including a differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place under recovery of the Nadir blood sample or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except for neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled when a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity of 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose-reductio- or so- continued occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above, there is an increased side effect risk in patients aged 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, exceeding the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Creatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- Border and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold the upper limit value (with liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone-therapy and Pemetremixed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neutrophils has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the number of thrombosis once again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute number of neutrophils, the number of thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-crematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was omitted when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed need to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid concurrent use of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for whom treatment with Pemetremixed need to avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days prior to treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the effluent before Pemetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with Pemetrexed, if this compound was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible foaming of the reproductive capacity is by Pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the treatment - Ginns to obtain advice regarding the sperm preservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin clearances ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) can lead to reduced Pemetrexed excretion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable, if high doses of NSAIDs or ce- tylsalicylic acid in high doses can be used in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin clearances ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to treatment, be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetremixed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Because no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib are available, the simultaneous use of Pemetremixed must be avoided at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetremixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetremixed for pregnant women, but as with ande- and anti-timetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy, unless strictly required and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to Pemetremixed, men should be advised prior to the beginning of treatment to obtain advice regarding the lock-retention.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetremixed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and randomised cisplatin and Pemetremixed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who randomised cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2419">The clinically relevant laboratory toxicity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the condensed results of three single Pemetrexed-Monotherapies, except neutropenia (12.8% compared with 5.3%) and an increase in the alanine transaminase (15.2% compared to 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population, since the Pha- se 2 studies both chemonaive and well pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests included.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is a antineoplastic antifolate that performs its effect by interrupting persistent follicle-dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed works as an antifolate with several targets by blocking the thymus dyspsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycine-dribonucleotide for- myltransferase (GARFT), which are non-follicated key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis by thymid- and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, easy-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant Pleuramesothelioma demonstrated that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of a median 2.8-month prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only affectionate with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medicine in the treatment arm (randomized and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the common cisplaine arm (218 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the food, whereby about a quarter of the fats being added to the food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains at the anus, flatus (winch) with chair, stool, oily / oily chair, leaving oily secretion (feces), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be used in patients who suffer from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and pregnant women or nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a licence for the company Glaxo Group Limited to approve the transport of orlistat GSK across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocalory, fat-induced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2514">"" "" "" "alli must not be applied by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety." ""</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is resorbed to only minimal, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Hyperensitivity against the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin • Treatment of cholestase • Pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Still Time (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or low fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes is accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent the oral contraception possibly possible in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma bar was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">For the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (international normal-ised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most of the patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take an additional multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the addition of a one-time dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects noted after the market launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as indicated in the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by the lipassive properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect lies in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active serine-rest of gastric and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">In clinical studies, it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalische, fatty diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their basic weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo plus 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average LDL cholesterol ratio was 60 mg -3.5% (starting value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo plus 3.8% (starting value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist measurements, the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value of 103,7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (starting value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable in 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in the plasma was only sporadic and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who administered the minimal systematic reabsorbed dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1) were identified, which represented approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies on safety pad toxicology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular risk for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alois is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, dioxetubicine or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information regarding the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the severe trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd to approve the transport of Aloha across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloha for preventing nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the thickness of the colon, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of subacute Ileus should be monitored closely after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable while offering Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapeutic gift, Aloxi will not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the following days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit tumor-directed activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between a one-time intravenous ponosetron and a Steady state- Concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as of CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromaine, chinidine, pritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences regarding the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events (a total of 633 patients) were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly were related to Aloxi (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and administration reactions (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events as in other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Dialysis studies have not been carried out because of large departmental volume, however, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for Aloe overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind studies, 1,132 patients who received moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 doxetron (half-life 7.3 hours) received at day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a double-blind study, 667 patients who received highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazron, and 250 or 750 mcg. of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of palposetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in healthy people and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to IV administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that once a once-daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to three consecutive days, the overall texture (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to that measured after one-off intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAX was higher following the dosage of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was rediscovered within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous captive bolt injection in healthy eyes, the total length of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal Elimination Ordinance and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ionic channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose met roughly 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans), given daily for over two years, led to increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasma (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumors in rats but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the failure of the authorization for the marketing of the medicines provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A, which is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "referral medicine" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage causes damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanin amine otransferase (ALT) are elevated in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data proving the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drugs to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease increased again in more patients than in the reference drug, and Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to assess the extent to which the medicament forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) are not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection with a crust) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinic Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo discussed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, approximately 90% of patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective in treating abscesses (eitermed cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the surface of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitization or serious local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is aborted, the ointment is thoroughly wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">It should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected spot occurs after a 2 or 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinosamicinulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on a weakened skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant escapement in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAX increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on a diminished skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adaptations are not considered necessary when topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinosamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment should be continued with Altargo, the benefit of breastfeeding should be weighed for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the site of administration which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effect of Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated through fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passantagerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding points of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the transfer of peptidyltransfer, block of P-binding inter-actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s-ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should counselling by experts should be sought due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of Retapamulin at at least some infection forms, a consultation should be aimed at by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% reapamulin saline was performed daily in occlusion on intact skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondarily traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skewed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the reapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsomes was mediated primarily by CYP3A4, under the low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity to rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid disease.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis for gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in the cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats microkernel for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were no signs of reduced fertility in male nor female rats at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which resulted in a reduction of up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skewed skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (reduced body weight of foetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity have been detected.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the licensing agreement must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the marketing application (version 6.2), works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the licensing agreement is committed to conducting detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Medicinal Products for Human use," the updated RMP will be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is looking on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort will occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gazeverstrip unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "ambient Memory" "" "is used as part of a two-stage vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccine existing from two doses can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same components as the Vaccine Twin Vaccine approved since 1996 and the Vaccine of Twinet admitted since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinmatrix adults and Twinmatrix children are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinmatrix adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinmatrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody-concentration a month after the last injections.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">With 98% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix showed a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody levels against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambience was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambienta (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain in the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The first dose at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is given.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated using the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HAV) antibodies are the same as after vaccination with the monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have approached hepatitis A vaccination need a refresher vaccination as they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection drugs, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the administration of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the combination vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form alininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and people with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibody levels after the immunization process, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impablection, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In cases of thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, however, Ambirix can be injected exceptionally subcutaneous as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambient matrix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mass mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier Thiomery and preservative-containing vaccine formulations.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15, the compatibility of Ambience was compared to that of the three-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mateness on a calculation base per vaccdose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambienta at 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of the three-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete inoculation cycle, 66.4% of the participants who had given Ambience had pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects that had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable to per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle in 39.6% of the subjects receiving Ambience, compared with 36.2% in the subjects receiving the three-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maturality was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360-ELISA units of form alininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with ambierix a common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose Vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted with vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were 1 month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered by the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted between 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluated, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with ambierix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunological responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with ambierix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360-ELISA units of form alininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies could be demonstrated for at least 24 months after immunization with ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that, which after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of form alininactivated Hepatite A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refresection of a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum rates similar to previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be investigated both before and after the resusment for possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix does not completely protect from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been concluded with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B Virus before administration of both vaccines Ambirix is (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the vaccination point), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to ambient lipase or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itching rashes, shortness of breath, swelling of the face or tongue. • If you / your child have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly protect against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually prescribed dose of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with ambierix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constituents per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a form alininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective constituents is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambienta is injected to individuals suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defences or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambient Assisted may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to the vaccination may not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been known since the issuance of the first permit for placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambience remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since ambirix has been put into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this drug are limited due to low patient exposures.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammount can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonium encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammount is - split up to several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomy hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nose tube (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because Ammony could not be compared to another treatment or placebo (a false medicine, that is, without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammount can also lead to loss of appetite, a abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headaches, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammount in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammount was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval, only limited information on this medicine was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete lack of enzyme already in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifolated form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests after the first month of life), an indication for use occurs when hyperammonia encephalopathy exists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manimanifest deficiency of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine ocarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Arginine should receive a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day with arginine-synthetase deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk of the formation of oesophagus ulcera when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolization and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat are carried out via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal propagation and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed ripening of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be established whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during lactation (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least one undesirable event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and at 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoric neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">In the case of an overdose, a 5-month old child with an inadvertent dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms begin with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity with intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">As a matter of fact, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogenous atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers to excrease excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of digested sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifolate form of the disease with the onset of early symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogue within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to haemodialysis, the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonian encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-stage form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the nipple transluorcarbamylase deficiency), which were treated with hyperammonium encephalopathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment and a further worsening of neurological condition may occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is contained in liver and kidney enzymatic glutamine, producing phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were measured after giving a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">After different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) the next morning, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was detectable in the morning after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients treated with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean concentrations of phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no complained effects in the case of toxic and non-toxic dosages (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who can still not swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostoma cord or a nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manimanifest deficiency of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine ocarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat) before birth, there were lesions in the pyramidal cells of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoric neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Susceptibility to interference: phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogenous atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers to excrease excess nutrients.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of research on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, we can assume that the sodium phenylbutyrat has been produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment, and a further worsening of neurological condition may occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granulate form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During shelf life, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">The small measuring spoon is 0.95 g, the middle measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g of sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding period, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine could pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, flavorings, impaired hearing, disorientation, memory deficits and worsening of existing neurological conditions were also observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find one of these symptoms, contact your doctor or emergency room at your hospital for the treatment of appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example, in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "standing uplift" (an anomalous measuring value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in combination with a Glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-coagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During PCI, the patient was often used as a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent a closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without Gift of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularisation) after 30 days or one year overall just as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angiox was just as effective in all indicators as Heparin, except for heavy bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalidorine, other hirudine or any other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the transport of angioxin across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST) infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is subsequently performed, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Just before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single retinal detachment of angioxins has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to use and the bolus dose should be administered quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which may be PCI (whether treated with ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT level is 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is checked again 5 minutes after the second round of the bolt.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which was included in the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the biopsy was administered without dose adjustment, with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the IV administration of fractional Heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against hirudine • active hemostasis and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe renal damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis-based patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalier is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in case of PCI-patients the majority of blood clots occur at arterial points of point, patients with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can occur during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with Bivaliddin, monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with Bivalier once again reaches the pre-treatment level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, warfarin, thrombocyte aggregating inhibitors) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalidorine with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are to be monitored regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">In terms of effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, bandaging or postnatal development, the animal-experimental studies are inadequate (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalidorine alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalidorine plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfactional Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalidorine group as well as in the treatment groups treated with Heparin, women as well as in patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe hemorrhages were defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding, as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among Bivalier than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intra-cranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area that required radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of haemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhages, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasional), were "other" point points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with a Bivalidin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalidorine group and in the treatment groups treated with Heparin, women as well as in patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleedings were significantly less common among Bivalier than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are summarised in table 6 according to system organ classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the event of an overdose, the treatment with Bivalidin is to be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mesmerized with regard to the signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalidorine, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center and the anion indentation region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalidorine to thrombin, and hence its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on its part slowly splits the binding of Bivalidorine-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, there was no thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) to induce thrombocyte aggregate reaction in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalidora shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is evidenced by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was subsequently performed, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalier should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfactional Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIb / IIIa inhibitor either before angiography (at the time of randomisation) or in the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="2933">ACUITY study; 30-day and 1-year risk difference for the combined ischemic endpoint and its components for patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol *</seg>
<seg id="2934">Patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol were arm A Arm B Arm C UFH / Enox Bival B- A C- A Bival + GPIIb / IIIa + GPIIb / IIIa Risk Diff.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The incidence of bleeding both in the ACUITY- and the Timi scale up to day 30 for the overall population (ITT) and for patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol is shown in table 9.</seg>
<seg id="2936">According to the protocol UFH / Enox Bival Bival + + GPIIb / IIIa alone + + GPIIb / IIIa (N = 2911) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604)</seg>
<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intra-cranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area, reduction of the hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information about the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalidorine were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalier as peptide goes through catabolism into its amino acid components with subsequent redistribution of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the split of ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on the conventional safety pad toxicology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10-faths of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) restricted to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects following a longer-term physiological stress as a reaction to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure to those in clinical application, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the manufacturing of the ready-to-use solution does not take place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose-through bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml, which is sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed a cap of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a bottle of angiox and slightly waved until everything has dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for the injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml in order to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml Bivalidin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes needing treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or unable to process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active duration than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 grown-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the HbA1c concentration fell 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other components or patients who already suffer from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that may affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the upper thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal bell.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (her- iter), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in the need for insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dose or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The change of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in dosage necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change if the treatment schemas change.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances which increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoroxetine, postoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Sympatholytics, such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserpine, can be alleviated or missing the symptoms of the adrenergic antigene regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisins enter human breast milk, but generally insulin is not absorbed into breast milk nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following are listed in clinical trials, which are known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organic classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, lightheadedness, excessive strain, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipoystrophy If the injection point within the injection region is continuously changed, a lipoystrophy can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous glucose administration by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucosine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur- cause of severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose uptake (in particular through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as through the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than with cou- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes millim- tus, insulin lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glucosa-reducing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosescortical effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that a similar postprandial glycemic control is reached in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Became insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycemic control is achieved, such as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- grooves prior to the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin administered in 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal malfunctioning, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
