package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the map tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard package modules from package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Canc@@ el . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available , delete .
the module an@@ ser filter ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : document@@ ate , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can be easily detected if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simplify navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over the View color mode can either display depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file feature such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if sufficient space is available for display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( whereby the display error can occur by limitations on the character of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
with representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . this target is not always observed . parameters are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework needs space that is then no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how divided the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always possible to divide the areas in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles arise which are as square as possible . the best methods in this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the View menu item View on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ass application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image Gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu in Tools View picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl + I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you visit the gallery gallery , a dialog opens up which allows you to specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a script to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
with the File Name box in the image , you specify whether the file names are shown in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .

in the Fol@@ der folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the sub@@ folder check@@ box , you can set with a slider or a rotation field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
with the check box original pictures , you can specify whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
using the comment field check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings gives you easy access to general &amp; HTML ; Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use this to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing skills can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , they should report trouble and improvement possibilities .
this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we encourage you to join the user mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; join . you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ cam ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn about shared releases and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to take part in &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instruction to login to the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
when you have digi@@ cam ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path names or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will additionally be used as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . customize digi@@ k@@ am collections collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ cam ; looks at any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder , you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ cam ; Dur@@ ing recur@@ sively reads the library path in its full depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put them on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ cam ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Record button to manage your photos in the albums .
shell Backup : if you use the blank mode of your camera , it can also handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu .
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h decoder settings and raw workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 oder i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a disk device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ v@@ ates . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ its over the serial port are slow , this connection has become out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images of digi@@ cam can be retri@@ eved reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things in &amp; digi@@ cam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; , Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier to digi@@ code ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes have been digi@@ ti@@ zed ; self .
to simplify the window , you can choose either side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the al@@ ame tree , via the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be dropped into keywords , data list or search .
- a file type sel@@ ector allows you to figure out the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are displayed in the symbol view currently . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame works only if it is shown in the symbol view . which fields are displayed you can configure in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select Album Im@@ por@@ tate screen@@ shot .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the pop @-@ up menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to right click on the album and select album properties on the pop @-@ up menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can group them under a common name . the collection you put is used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete new collections . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the Settings for collections .
the album date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with View records sorted by date .
the buttons El@@ dest , average , New ester : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; edited , the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As the album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album on the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the pictures in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait for a moment while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all preview images .
information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information these are can be edited through Settings &#124; Settings . select here the albums page and customize the area thumb@@ nails to your li@@ king .
the thumb@@ nails have help buttons that appear . the help shows the most important properties including all the key features of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the Intro@@ duction in the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about digi@@ cam ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with right mouse button and edit ... select . in section digi@@ cam ; Image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ cam ; the functionality you need is not provided . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . to do this , and how to customize them to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , it is possible to avoid problems with the metadata contained in the picture . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select Dre@@ ams . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo taken from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete , you can do this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My date List ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the calendar view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
keywords are provided by a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by this you can lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ pi@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the key words you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click an existing keyword and then select Cre@@ ate Cre@@ ate . if you have a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the option to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right clicking it and editing the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album on the list to set it as a symbol .
to use it &apos;s functionality with keywords , you first have to add your photos with keyword . this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to add with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also right click on the preview of the pictures and choose from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way , you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have a photo with keyword , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the keywords menu . the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the Tim@@ eline View displays a time @-@ dependent adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you just have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection box indicating the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
include all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps , and even more in the future .
next to search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds matches . if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp will rot .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you typ@@ ed as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your choice , press OK and the Search will be performed . the results are displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the form will return to search again with the previously entered search information . if you select as advanced search , the dialog will appear for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Clear Search in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ cam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are displayed line @-@ wise , separated by operators . any option can be associated with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... You can create searches of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sign@@ atures . the less the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or decreased . if you slide a picture from somewhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the appropriate pictures . also here , a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini Program . press the mouse wheel or zoom out or hold it and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this implies , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this is then added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lamp table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Li@@ gh@@ table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened . if you are back in the &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras .
from the preview pane you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select a preview from the toolbar and perform z@@ oos or move operations on one of the images , then these are also executed in the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use combination mode from the toolbar , then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison . now , use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane .
of course , normal dele@@ tions work directly from the beam table , like F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you have to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in Mode Pre@@ view , both images will show the same image area .
the zoom functions as well as in other views . just use the zoom slider below the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the bu@@ zz@@ word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos recei@@ v@@ ables , scans or stores digital photos carries out a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , protect , convert , group , backup , evaluate , categ@@ ori@@ ze , backup , review , sample , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , seeks , transformed , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data , which provides information about or documentation of other data , which are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to take stock management for longer a certain photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether other access to your photos should have , whether you want to save them to a network drive , etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
we also recommend saving the metadata in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to enable it . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this then you can later save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to add &amp; edited a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then .
now let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you often see in other programs , or Categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded keyword , then &amp; digi@@ cam ; automatically build the tree for you or add the images to the right place . converting the tree within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drawing a sub @-@ tree to another .
this is a very rough representation since every block of metadata is in truth out of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you just want to let anyone know your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance , there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing stage of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming , having associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer , to help Him over the motive that has moved you to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as cap@@ tion . if you export your images to web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your specifications in the cap@@ tion and / or title of the web gallery system .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to navigate to another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now works with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually review your trips using pictures with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ cam ; can also export the photos to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps be@@ holder .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the set page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author &apos;s title : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples of this may be titles such as : employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this , in the picture . for private individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; nbsp ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , this cau@@ tious approach must be dealt with and you can &apos;t wait longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollars ; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the correct way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if they have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CD and DVDs , there &apos;s a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
slowly burn with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . then read the data again to check you . also , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then copy it to a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to transfer the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your stat@@ s for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject .
in brief : dis@@ ks keep the longest if you operate in the Temper@@ ature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower anne@@ aling the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure . S@@ MAR@@ T errors indicate the im@@ minent failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices don &apos;t matter much , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug connector .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , please ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that all peripheral devices connected to your system may also be protected by this . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sp@@ outs , which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it may be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models even allow them to continue to work until the current is running again . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the provided software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of power problems with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to 20 euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than 20 euro ; at the end , you should always remember to keep all cables before you go on vacation .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can integrate it as your drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as your backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
you are at home in comparison to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online .
from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically adjusted and in the large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it &apos;s quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . no one ever seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss since they generate inter@@ s@@ ms within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS is using and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than for example th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden breakdown during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture setting of fundamental physical borders . meaning that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to get worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make no one responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss . so , backup your data frequently on a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ aster prevention always means not local storage . bring up your back@@ ups the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made . this backup comes with an version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only scann@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come up with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , original memory , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ invent images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable on the basis of your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way than to for@@ ge a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional impression of the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . for * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t impose it on it .
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ db .
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( de@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open blank image format developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed because of the need to standardi@@ ze the camera image formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use Canon and Nikon &apos;s competi@@ tor .
this may be one of the reasons why to replace 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive the original of your photo , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits because it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can lead to problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard compounds and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera editor , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert the raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these may be trun@@ cated by the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web galleries , encoding them in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ cam ; to get . in the Ad@@ ding a photos to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect them to your computer , switch the camera to the display mode and switch on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a ready indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your machine is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures are securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the selected using the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download the selected button . the button selected can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these pictures have not yet been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; downloaded . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you are using the Show all or download Sel@@ ected Show , a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of the existing albums is shown , as usual folder . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; edited ; load the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , you must select it first and then delete Aus@@ Modi@@ fied deleted .
please note that there is no possibility to restore photos you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a digi@@ cam ; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera completely , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use descri@@ p@@ tive names for the photos . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you upload photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options which are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % d % H % H : % M : % S in the editing field . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments you should read the str@@ f@@ time help .
if you are using the option Camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lo@@ wer@@ case . or in capital letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the point of time recording to perform automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the page strip metadata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it can be digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , it can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case save &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based bas@@ kets at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your machine to your camera is the Download button . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ cam ; you know where the pictures are to be uploaded . a folder choos@@ er dialog for the camera will appear . select here the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . the data can be processed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architects offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser showing the area . if you want to send a postcard to another location , or want to send a user who can locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that it supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transfer of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ 1 or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic allocation .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the call@@ sign ind@@ ented coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to give you as much control over its operations as possible . there are many settings that modify the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you need to edit in the Settings menu ; set up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . even with a database synchronization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s title : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s professional title . this can be labels such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as they offer the picture to others &amp; quot ; if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ s.@@ This ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of digi@@ cam ; . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; digi@@ cam ; without getting lost .
images saved as embedded labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ cam ; display tries , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
each time you open the lighting table these settings are switched on . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in picture editing , this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF @-@ files option you can to@@ g@@ gle the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
if you select the los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in planning .
in earlier versions of digi@@ cam ; image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present , it quickly evolved into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the rendered green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , which is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the peak lights in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the cutting lights , so the parts of your images that are burned are , due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights , as a continuous whit@@ ening . the setting colors will trigger some unusual results , since they can re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; red@@ ressed ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not satisfied blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
when selecting the re@@ construct option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should be individually adjusted for each image .
you probably have to set it higher than standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing . to keep the time for the demo@@ li@@ tion small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ structure .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ rap@@ pers provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ous Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ rap@@ in . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts at the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction , as it is performed during shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ cam ; information such as colour information from one color space to translate to the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / Start colour management module with raw files .
color profile Fol@@ ders Set the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles .
settings of ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not include color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping yourself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print a picture as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated . you could manually correct this instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately not on the models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the destination : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by delivering this interface can &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules that were written to work with any program supporting the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and they are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; loaded . these modules appear as new entries in the main window &apos;s menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quick instructions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switch the metadata to or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features show a list of all currently supported cameras on the left side . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . below are the port settings . currently , Seri@@ al , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 oder i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you will need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on .
try whether &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window &apos;s cameras . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ cam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections Del@@ ete a photo and delete an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam ; used if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you must save the changes using the Edit button .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ cam ; disable when starting . this will speed up the start of the digi@@ cam ; .
the Set@@ ting Start after new photos was forcing &amp; edited ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the start time of &amp; digi@@ cam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ cam ; you , if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ cam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from Settings design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use this to view and correct your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting View / Edit menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ cam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top and the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used the Save or Save button from the toolbar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with File Save as executed .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button from the File menu or use the button The Rest@@ ore the image processing button in the toolbar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving .
almost any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Modi@@ fy or Rest@@ ore editing by selecting Edit Re@@ produce from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ switch @-@ Z to recover .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the picture editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in that you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select En@@ larger Factor automatically
view full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you will get to the normal view by using the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can see this in the setting dialog of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences . you just have to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Ex@@ por@@ tate Digital Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right side which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should note these limitations .
after you have commented , either use the button App@@ ly or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
besides the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to rate multiple images at the same time , select this and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword @-@ word and a box with the keywords used previously in this digi@@ cam ; -@@ session used keywords .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly narrow down the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords for a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords may also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the keyword IP@@ TC keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of the shown pictures in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search . if additionally one or more key@@ word@@ filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking whether you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword has been drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled in settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the rules section .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; edited ; s specific implementation .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor resem@@ ble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web will correspond to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices to make you get the desired result .
if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other images are e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should I use another color space and then have to worry about colour management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor when I chose to work in a s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is plu@@ gging the circle . if you work as in the color space of s@@ RGB , then you either need to connect your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , please use it before you try further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Fig@@ ures , Automati@@ cally Fig@@ ures and Con@@ tr@@ ast extension from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
the same : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel gets as flat as possible . sometimes the equivalent results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either generates miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a newcom@@ er to all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to do the white balance of a photo .
if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correc@@ ting will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Col@@ ors White Balance of the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance , then click the sub@@ window to click .
the thumb@@ nail preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow calibration lets you improve or down@@ grade the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the Pre@@ ferences panel . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
the pres@@ et button res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save these settings , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed picture here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time , and is only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for brightness . detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted from the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under color sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously , so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ cam ; the colour effects tool provides you with four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that arose when a partially developed pressure applied to a short flash light and afterwards the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter parts were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the sol@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via &apos;s name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it the film of choice for wildlife photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level parameter controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma the tool is based on sound correction for improvement of exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the application described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three slides are cli@@ cked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the knob to make sure the image changes .
on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically using the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three knob : the upper@@ most for the dark tones , the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color pin@@ boards can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for any shade , medium and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
half of the original and the target image will be displayed on the left side . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows the channel specified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most meaningful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a short part to the right , e.g. the bright notes , you can see that these bright notes correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels are darker .
you can see a red marker on the preview of the original photo . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and then loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shad@@ ow@@ - , mid@@ - and sun shades . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; channel bl@@ ender &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication as you can correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison over your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ anz , the picture will also retain the general brightness as the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color will result in a visible noise coming from the color space . if this is the case you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender set can be saved for later and then loaded . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed picture under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be converted easily on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus , like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , like the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of day . thus , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shade tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of magni@@ fied points or as a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the impression of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) can be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly surrounding the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ ed effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously used .
with this handy tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this can also be done in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool sten@@ cil you can put a template over a picture .
the Menu picture template used in image editing can be used to lay templates on a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the digi@@ cam ; templates database , simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the Device base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the templates files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder refresh@@ es the preview pane of the templates automatically .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other fields .
sharp@@ ness is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image shar@@ per . actually , it does not work a bit , it works rather audiovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digital@@ isation process colours with only minimal differences to one color point . this in turn leads to blur@@ red edges . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a field of sharp@@ ness already while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get the control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this can be done using the menu item Cor@@ rigid Fol@@ low .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a bit sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ tness and experiment with some settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are generated close to sharp edges .
the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . this makes it possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with soft switching between tones are excluded and therefore beauty defects in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filtering . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted filtering algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche fold . the G@@ auss sian fold has a very long tail , which means that the mathematical result also depends on the swelling pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the F@@ IR Vienna in@@ verse of the G@@ auss curve is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . this causes undes@@ ired results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the standard value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values close 1 , eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise Filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß &apos; is . this is most often caused by a previously performed bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge . note , however , that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to make all blan@@ ks , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that lots of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but will later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , eg . than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp masks produce better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by pin@@ ching a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal lens filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the sharp@@ est mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original blur@@ red color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the knob tigh@@ tens the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ts allow a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ legal algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fin@@ er you can use the tab@@ s smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoo@@ thing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that no sharpen@@ ing should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction dependen@@ cy .
directional dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes uni@@ form@@ ly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ining or CCD h@@ iss will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how many times the algorithm is passed . normally , one or two is sufficient .
angle @-@ step @-@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral incre@@ ment in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal . however , it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and then loaded again .
image errors corrected is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected using small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the trip .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ Eff@@ ects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be removed successfully using this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter uses per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller errors corrected .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel gap to the front of the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is raised , the noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer obtain and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the filter &apos;s frequency response . if it is too strong , it is not possible to remove all rou@@ gh@@ ness or noise peaks . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without loos@@ ing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more rou@@ gh@@ ed up . however , it also sums up the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of the phase absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges . it can remove rou@@ gh@@ spi@@ kes and is the recommended method for it .
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be saved to the file system and then loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is labeled with ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) . noise reduction was used with default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ tness and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ fitted digi@@ ti@@ zed images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG compression arti@@ facts : compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far away . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected one under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old colour photo that was scann@@ ed using a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
das &amp; digi@@ kam ; Tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
light , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality rough @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button Dark Image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you connect the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD de@@ fil@@ ements .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixels . note that the Wi@@ zard will remember the last dark image and automatically rel@@ o@@ ad it in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an intersection of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction applied on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image can be seen under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo formats , often cannot light the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ er@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
there are also disadvantages . many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which means that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should , even with center filters , use an opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise the sharp@@ ness effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s films and the gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image without this filter .
with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity adjustment at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or by chance a lumin@@ ance of 2 .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image using the vi@@ gn@@ etting correct reduces the brightness of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options . the controls only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of vi@@ gn@@ etting gra@@ ding applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens bias is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but flat@@ ters at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners opposed to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion @-@ fourth degree . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the in@@ verse in@@ signia of the parameter in general .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus correc@@ ts first gra@@ des . negative values increase while positive image res@@ izes .
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview of the distortion Cor@@ rection is illustrated . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values next time .
the correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . if you re @-@ cut an image and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would seem obvious .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to view the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu Select s@@ lic@@ ing from image editing or via Zoom Custom@@ ers of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives like shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ e.@@ org website which is accessible via this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters set of film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add Film Pun@@ ishment if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green law@@ ns are white like snow !
as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture under ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in peak lights .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix big silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ p@@ one into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , from the other side , looks at the arti@@ sen@@ ess .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the dig@@ ging ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coal sket@@ ch . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch out . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller adju@@ sts the pin size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ cam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to wave blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to be comp@@ uted and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ ity : blur@@ ts the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixel around a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ts the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to appear in the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photos , camera .
sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton &apos;s effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ts the image through random shifting of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the paint tank in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to be comp@@ uted and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the Stop button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops to your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can use the digi@@ cam ; image processing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can fix it by mirr@@ oring or turning into the correct orientation .
photo blo@@ cker is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and hold the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you retrieve the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
change the tool to size using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo blo@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the new size aspect ratio is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly to do so . enlarge each listing for photo can be saved as a text file and then loaded again .
photo blo@@ cker is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo @-@ bubbles by magni@@ fying a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo is cut away . this gives you a good overview how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply clicking the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The Rand@@ om button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the Save or File menu entries under the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview pane you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained .
in the following aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the higher value of height and width is always assigned to the width .
cut the tool After aspect ratio use a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the encoding help settings allow you to hide help so that you can better put your images together . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ wing rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden mean : the golden mean is a division based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean .
the golden mean provides more liquid resource lines if you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos to achieve your goal . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river on this way .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that direc@@ ts the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral , discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be seen a static object of dynam@@ ism .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try placing your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al Mir@@ ror and Ver@@ tical Options can be used to mirror the harmonic divi@@ den@@ ds .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing and the tool free rotation . select Transformation Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the pres@@ ets button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function transform@@ ieren sel@@ ections from image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is to cut the function Automati@@ cally . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . but please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
turning right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes blur@@ red . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you will get unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformer cutting from the image editing .
a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ieren sciss@@ ors .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can rotate horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview pane .
to your help a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the adjustment tool to adjust your image .
after you &apos;ve done the lubrication , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two scra@@ pers produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformer cutting from the image editing .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ cam .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; shows only files in formats that know it . this is done based on file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is specified in the list , the file can be edited in the editing pane . you can change this list of file extensions to digi@@ cam ; be accepted . in the configuration section you will find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s release can also save los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert Ra@@ w format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the configuration section you will find more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contain more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that have been digi@@ ti@@ zed ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; and digi@@ cam ; understands these formats and will have no built @-@ in movies to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ cam ; use &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies to start the program for playback .
go forward to the previously visited record in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward when you have gone back before .

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contain . your description follows here .
all image editing tools like sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , Un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialogue type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture used by applying ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ licate . the top area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to show over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general Settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the properties side bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini Program . press the mouse wheel or zoom out or hold it and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this implies , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the pallet load dialog , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders according to files .
the cursor is shown as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the palette view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box In Com@@ m C@@ ursor is enabled under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ rides another one ; depending on whether the mode over@@ ride is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the over@@ writing box under Com@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection created in this way as described in the last section can be used together with the Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste actions .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for clip@@ board data : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character followed by a line @-@ ending character , if there are three figures in the clip@@ board , these can be added as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; dot ; graph@@ ene . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z programs are used in science , especially in computer science . previously there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; include , are according to the program author out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well @-@ built &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Plac@@ ement ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; posters ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and shows in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; to open or graph in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in a &amp; Plac@@ ement ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . needed in detail :
the main window shows the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without launching an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file , and the ( empty ) list of Rest@@ ored files . click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file is changed from another program , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also remember your decision , so you can change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu option k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... see also .
when you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ put@@ viewer ; instance open , eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; or want to display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
when you start the program , you can open all of the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice and change it later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with another font
the Renew@@ al Lo@@ ad page gives the option of setting the behavior if a file has been modified on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or leave the program every time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; specify if a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ ghted graphs . it produces representations according to the spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and contains a multi @-@ lat@@ ch for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the no@@ des circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ cal structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the graph@@ ite file , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ chtet ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ corrected graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it needs the following packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the tool@@ bars for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol .
create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose whether to create the symbol from a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch .
restore the last revers@@ ed step . if you don &apos;t have a step reverse , this function is down@@ lighted .
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey scales . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol range of &amp; k@@ de .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color on the color of the point you click .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbol gri@@ ds .
with buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change templates for standard file , source file , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
choose Transpar@@ ent Pixel or display lin@@ e@@ els and place in @-@ color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a banner . you can also choose for the chess board size : the diamonds on Klein , Medium and Large , as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module includes images to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you scan the menu item , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . here , select the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the default values duc@@ r@@ he own to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after scanning the button , you need to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the image file options appears . here you can specify compression and type of image file . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore produces very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .

the Ex@@ por@@ tiere to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you will be led through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication . it is thus virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed to Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current permissions for the module . to upload , you need write permissions . the module currently does not support any other permissions . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to proceed with these permissions .
the button Add images should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking on the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the key field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options allow you to set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken out of the value registered with Maximum size .
the Maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
K@@ IP@@ I Galerie @-@ Export is a tool for ex@@ porting your collection of images to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I ge@@ ographi@@ cally loc@@ alization module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF key words of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I ge@@ ographi@@ cally loc@@ alization module provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ GB can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . to perform a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same places as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data will be recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera will be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . set your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera @-@ time . if the vari@@ ance is then the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no track data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference options in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and reset with the displayed map . select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Make this through time and again until you have reached a sufficient level of accuracy . the map can be switched between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ t@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the Ri@@ der selection allows you to select all albums you want to export to HTML . you just need to select those albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on an image , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ,
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth . this naturally also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Tab@@ s for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the programs to determine if errors occurred while generating . the web browser will automatically end up to view the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a wind@@ owed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the below actions , without the usual losses on quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list for the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at hex@@ id@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for slideshow . with this module it is possible to create DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates a very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave them black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g if possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings according to your wishes , you can start with the button encoding the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go for a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if a hint appears that codes or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button at the bottom .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : make sense to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import / convert your images saved in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera developer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Image Converter Window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG is using a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file is saved in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image that is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
proportional ( 1 den@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 den@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format .
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent in advance .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be shown with the pictures you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image a preview is shown on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and drop them to the list of images to be sent .
with the Del@@ ete button , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure not to send too many images at once . most email accounts have limitations on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window with questions about how to display your slideshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL rendering option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions thanks to Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , because otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually start off with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . thus , the order of the images is not used in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are about 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the lower left edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting an image as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparing it with the image , there are now entries in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you click with the mouse on the entry persons , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view with preview images to view the pictures of your sphere of action .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you defined by yourself .
in order to display images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable picture for your keywords ) .
however , you need to define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the Picture An@@ si@@ fier window ( in detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you view the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . this dialog can be viewed in the image again .
if you enter a string in the label or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but prefer to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick jump , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the photo@@ album ; demo mode in the Help menu . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list you can see here : . as the name implies , this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database , displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select a range , you will be shown in the preview pane only pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the File menu File .
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first enter the title of the revision and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages , see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file to be created which is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that are obvious to the viewer without the description . for example , that all pictures are taken from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images . this requires those who look at your website and own a monitor , which supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages were created should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . that the import function , see , correct , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the setting options described above have all three to base folders or URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in these , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of all images in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file as independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the respective images are not found , the images of the URL you have when creating the HTML files will be scann@@ ed . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the manual to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy &amp; copy the photo@@ album automatically to the .@@ k@@ im file . the pictures will automatically copy for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal ZIP files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is the maximum size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , will &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of people of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window which categories of the file to be imported , and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can match the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it just has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your boy@@ friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced subjects and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been extended and today your videos will be taken care of . many places in this manual are talking about images , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal Backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are saved and use them in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the different settings will be explained in the following section of the user manual .
on the left you can see six different icons that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in this section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in .
in the selection list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ c@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page which you can access via the modules themselves .
since the modules are used together with one another , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore you should always test new modules with the demo database before using the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that share the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications arrange their images in albums : this kind of order does not support , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order for albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ate &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview currently .
next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to transfer a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . if you use , for example , the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you would have selected people to view and share this with the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the module you want to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and toolbar at the top . below the toolbar you will see the window that you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain a lot of information as you do not yet have any information about your images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture , where the picture was taken etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer .
this is a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are m@@ apped , you can , so that the names used are moved up , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabetical sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting icon on the list below .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the US . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a sub@@ group . to show you that this is a group , a special icon is displayed .
in the note panel &apos;s context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub @-@ category . additionally , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub @-@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the template that forms the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options ... button , which offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options button ... and then fade out the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the item pictures in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or of all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , to use pictures without having saved them on your hard drive . of course you have to have the pictures stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the pictures you need can be loaded from the hard drive .
images from which the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back again . so if you don &apos;t want to get anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the File menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end the ones you want to make available to others and click on current view lock in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also select all images that your little sister may see , control and select the menu item All except current view .
so you have specified which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you are giving the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item lock pictures , so that all images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click Lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered in order to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , everyone can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private pictures to those with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . these can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered in the picture , such as who is in the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the top of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag and drop them with the mouse . you can also configure which information to display and whether any information will be displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries for this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures by Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image down . you can jump to the first and last image using Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . you can zoom out to zoom in . the Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the Power key , the zoom sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they fall in and out with the plus and minus symbol .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the picture and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to provide pictures with characteristics while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you can see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have attributes to your pictures , these are available to you in the browser . so , if you have all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add all the images at once .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you view categories in the preview window , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will allow &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your painted later .
in the picture you can see a picture on which was painted . to turn on the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select On the picture paint from the context menu . to end the painting just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to know the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the right position :
you can remove selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu or from the right @-@ click context menu .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to App@@ ly these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message with a fault description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User Docum@@ entation in Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the shown object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains user documentation .
when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Properties View .
press Pre@@ view in the Properties View and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , tick locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility Level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the stage of visibility chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as pres@@ etting . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical opinions on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need another configuration , you can set it in any way . you can also save multiple window arrangements and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the tap to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
in order to create a new column , drag the link to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the p@@ asser in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map @-@ card @-@ tra@@ der at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the tap to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the attachment strip .
to close a view click on the small cross in the attachment strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views .
you can save the current window view with view window arrangement ... save it . a dialog will appear where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray was up to date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the View menu item .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , it makes sense , but a name that can recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image excerpt for rendering to the input fields .
in the drop down sel@@ ector quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lights . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this feature look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixels with one . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is continuously split up and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually tra@@ cked and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams are changed by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light re@@ flexi@@ on comp@@ utes . it takes very long to get a scene with this feature .
on this card card you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray is terminated un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , select the Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet full range of commands from &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds to the source text of the object in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the shown object . here , place the path to your retention and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , height field data ) in paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in camera view and in the window @-@ type plates .
you can set the object start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes section .
this page allows you to modify existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window instructions section , it explains how to create and store window arrangements .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : shows all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window arrangements displays all available window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to add the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view does not anchored in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in darkness and you only get a black image .
if you have installed everything flaw@@ lessly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre@@ defined window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , see more details .
do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the camera &apos;s target point . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
when you push the button App@@ ly or Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you might want to insert a Qu@@ ader ( insert End User Qu@@ ader ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some way to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly or Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , even if at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree , you will find that you can open the item for the floor , if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the object properties view .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise one unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please choose first object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the properties pane ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matte black material because you need to enter the settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , click the App@@ ly button and then click on the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the Object tree , you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose each time mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me and change the colors in the object properties view :
you should simply do this step , as you should have already understood the basic method of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the object properties view , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would ho@@ ver over the ground , because you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , set a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , the sphere gives a pigment as a color :
choose first object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then choose color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
the brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not selected at all :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
ra@@ y@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the Ren@@ derer is shooting hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the rendering calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog are affected .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . any changes since the last saved will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu item can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene .
repe@@ ats the last rever@@ sible command . this menu item can only be selected if you have used edit undo .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change the default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog for setting up the toolbar . you can add and remove to@@ oling symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
a dump @-@ map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be shown either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s , or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Configuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working mode of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set . in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cut keys can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . pres@@ etting is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , load &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; upon exit the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , click &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in wind@@ owed mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut for the various modes of use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays big icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
res@@ ize the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the digi@@ cam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ shot ; is part of the digi@@ cam ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image editing with some powerful Base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ down ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ shot , then we encourage you to answer questions about other users of &amp; show@@ shot ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best way to join the show@@ shot is to join the developer mailing list . instruction to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ shot ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; tries to give you as much control over its operations as possible . to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ shot menu in the Options menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should indicate a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ shot shows a side@@ bar on the right side which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side bar in the image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than images to scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make more than images to scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialogue for each image to save or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog box for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; finish .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview can and then scan scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the entire preview fits into the window .
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if a preview is displayed in the settings before saving , then the image will be shown in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button will open the dialog box in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images and is also the suggested name for the image in the Save dialog . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is recorded each time a picture is saved . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the Settings button displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to finish .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . caution : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs short@@ cuts . below is a list of this short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cut can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Global keyboard short@@ cuts ... by right @-@ clicking on the player window and setting short commands ... select .
you may set up any existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Quick instructions . this makes your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features that mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function pause might be &amp; z@@ b ; so look :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialogue so that the user knows why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands to be executed . this usually uses the ex@@ ec ( ) function . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure specifies the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signal that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions you can ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . in order to add an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove an entry .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; cancel , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. clearing operations . this includes e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script pack@@ ets which the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be packed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the exhaus@@ tion of amar@@ oc@@ ep@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music anew !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you shouldn &apos;t have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compilation options certain dependen@@ cies have to be met so that they can be used . for details see the System Requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in the player window , the player window will turn on or off to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . option to@@ g@@ gles the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . this modi@@ fies the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
dump files with the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ le / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list at exit , save the current playlist automatically when ending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist at exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date track when changing the play causes the playlist window to roll up / un@@ roll to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
switching to context @-@ browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the Fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set by marking sel@@ ections , the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window , and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a font from the selection dialog .
with the choice Custom color scheme , you have the choice of your choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated , for foreground and background color .
resume playback when resum@@ ing that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback continues automatically with the piece at the place with which it stopped during the last stop .
set up the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadows causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if you do not use custom colors , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the input field Display Text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below is a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment should appear the O@@ SD .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box . some drivers still activate further settings in this card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting as to how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively Browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse both the check@@ boxes as well as their sub@@ folders for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , additional setup is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup will be used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on Calcul@@ ator : the computer will be entered on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the load .@@ f@@ m card depends on the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can send the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get a list of similar performers to the played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work difficulties , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by checking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ it@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . then you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ hl@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
ensure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if such as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if this is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om@@ smo@@ dus / Rep@@ lication / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten .

to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version , or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for looking for help . please enter there only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok yourself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank Play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start -@@ sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Display Evaluation . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove From the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the addition button , the playlist will be stored . click on it .
you probably have the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be Which Media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . gam@@ ers can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default does not include any MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mmed mp3 , enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you sink the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you to search for the problem of the problem and a solution . for gam@@ ers , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( for instance , sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media need to be deco@@ ded first . you can not just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . gam@@ ers read the file , deco@@ ded them and send the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . gam@@ ers can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dreams the visu@@ aliz@@ ations react . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . execute log registers to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run the log @-@ register , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the latest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the log @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a full list of suggestions / desires , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm perform this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to get to know the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current tracks if you are on another computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and username with your username . this requires that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button puts a piece in the click order into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ ful functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control strip ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after starting Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?

basically , this adju@@ sts the previous assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can add the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , i.e. by right @-@ clicking on the item and Edit : select App@@ ly or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term planned Amar@@ ok Plan .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon while playing animations in general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar ... and make the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click on Cre@@ ate New Design ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .

audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio Ac@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably have to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... Audio output gives you the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog from x@@ ine , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio issue with Arts is not taken care of . of course , you are not allowed to take this issue yourself ! if you like , you can become the new super@@ visor for Arts : )

the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most widely developed playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features it does not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of features deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use , yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpretation .
if you already used previous versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window will have dropped off . the information presented there has now been divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first part in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z Symbol . click on this icon to recre@@ ate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover pictures in context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current one . the file formats are .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images embedded in either the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can choose which information to display in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts .
the Edit button enables you to edit the song text . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search for goo@@ gle@@ .com for the running track ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further distribution is made according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with various artists .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ts to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order , the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your songs are first sorted by genre and among them according to artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works as well as the above but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing as you like .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces it could take a while .
directly below the toolbar you find a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . in the section about the use of this filter you will find in the section about the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a drop @-@ down box with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options .
load - This del@@ etes the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the play .
app@@ end to playlist - Add selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queue . thus , you will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name where you want to save the list .
transfer to media players - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . see the section on the Media Player browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece @-@ information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
pick up a selection - Chan@@ ges a new album marked as a compilation back to a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes the handling of many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the play@@ lists contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Smart play@@ lists are possible . click Add Intelligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player &apos;s sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod sorted by performer in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the required titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files that do not meet your search criteria are hidden .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a entered URL . if you like to enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ c@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press enter key , you can play music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping it . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful . this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all the pieces you need to play . you can change the order by simply typing the entries with the mouse . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separate search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the keyword with quotation marks : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : review : &gt; 50@@ . This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain something .
for example , Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this search for all the pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click the entries in the desired order . entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar you find a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window via the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example , playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and setting up toolbar buttons .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the option status bar in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . through this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry will open the window Visu@@ alization Plugins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , a number in the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is first played , 2 second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the sequence of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ c@@ robat ) . this mode requires that some pieces already exist in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double click the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately complete your playlist and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists of Recommen@@ ded Parts begin with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece by yourself from your collection .
if you want to keep the latest playlist , enable the latest dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu item , dynamic mode can be disabled again .
the New button fills the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist has the ability to click Edit . as a result , the dialog will pop up to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear any double in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed with regard to the setting of pla@@ ited pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have selected .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Configuration .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog where you can select a script package for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ or@@ - and Enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 Enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write fla@@ c files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to then burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full @-@ featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can result in the unpleasant effect that the music pieces play differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog saving under is indicated by which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
close all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , which should be done , just as if you had called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project it is asked what to do with it , just as if you had called file closing .
when you go to this entry , you can select files to be added to the project via the appearing dialog . that &apos;s the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is the ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can also create only one image from a DVD , which you can then burn some time later . also , converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will delete the contents completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of toolbar dimensions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the Content View allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
the head@@ line is a narrow area that only appears when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line does not have a real function , it only looks pretty and separates the projection point clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment accordingly .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is more important to which the enclosed programs give you the preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you are using d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following to the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void fig@@ .@@ v@@ d ( ) void fig@@ .@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Administration ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String Administration ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String transmission ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; s and save it in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders who encoding ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) by default ( These enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved into WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself .
which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid purchasing copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often up to a suitable configuration ) , afterwards the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained . this ( hopefully ) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , all manually captured .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be made . )
start reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup di@@ alog - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already used file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog for the type of notification settings ( such as logs , pi@@ p@@ ples ) for program events ( such as read out &amp; CD ; finished ) .
open the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important , as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high pitch quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG plays is available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title must be added by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer instead . it is to be noted that here is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( Note the translator ) am not lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from going from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt . all information can be obtained anyway during a stroll through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator is set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the nearest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection tool is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save into WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the proper distribution first if this has not yet happened .
to save the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; kon@@ sole ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program make exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read out . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
it is necessary to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine , since it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permissions on it ( eg ; trying to copy something with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what each out@@ going &amp; CD must be repeated .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program with which fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them when reading a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom can be a symbolic link to the actual device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab will help and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map menu General settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is loaded / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only in the case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed if data for generating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet during the read @-@ out of the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; this is associated with minimal risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , this is above 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice whether this is worth it . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . mode is set up on the following card board .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , but as many fire@@ walls bo@@ k the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the 80 protocol , because the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take over the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously exhibiting pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author does not know , therefore just try himself .
CD ; throw out after reading the last piece : check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be level@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously encoding WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to encoding more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a default for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk is running . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was written in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is built , since we want to fetch data from fre@@ ed@@ b . the process that is described in this section has to be repeated for each extension &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data recorded for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments are pointing to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as an audio CD ; can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then look in the FAQ section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD was successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window will pop up , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; Settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD @-@ Editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD ; in this example it is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you will come back to the main window . just click on the row with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the BO@@ M .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off . make sure that all pieces are selected or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time .
by clicking on the button Select button to start reading the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running .
click on the Ri@@ ders tab to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we &apos;ve typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this will be read out and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to be a problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( of course two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will pop up with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; today is maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , because &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; one part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package .
this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of different learning flash@@ cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still reading it ? even if only the Help menu has been cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; may it do . at least after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange when you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need those informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as a sequ@@ encer is supported .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the track .
graphical representation of activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards for storing text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the method used .
session support . when you end up playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . this works also with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Del@@ ete button in the toolbar , select the item from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after another . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid plays a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the slider .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two functions : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the Pause Pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the piece , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; play .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song lyrics and others both . some pieces don &apos;t even have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically as@@ cer@@ tained , the one song is used , so you don &apos;t have to manually set the kar@@ a@@ oke message . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select from the Settings menu the entries Tex@@ ter@@ ei@@ ghts or Lie@@ der@@ ei@@ ghts . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section you will see how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will at the beginning contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the counter@@ f@@ eit in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by adding a song . it will again appear the file dialog with whose help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when a piece is opened . this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the pop @-@ up sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be reset .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke message .
to skip a song , select the next song button , add the item next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the previous piece button , previous item from the menu item or press the arrow button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when you leave &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map converts General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into Events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , and thus always lets a trumpet sound when a piano was originally supposed to play .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ aliz@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . the prerequisite for this is , however , that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; Support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ als string is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument requires to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a rif@@ le shoot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a rif@@ le shoot . to do this , enter the following into the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term drum patch included in the patch , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the rows is very important , as is their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you just have to use different names on the first line .
key maps are mainly used to depic@@ t sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the provided key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , just do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the 16 or 9 channels ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which attempt to change the patch on this channel .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion channel on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio specifies in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards will try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you will find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard , you see what sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played notes . view the view in the Settings menu under the Channel View menu : settings
the Tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t feel like adding all the files separately .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , make sure to set automatic addition to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , only change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , turn off the Set@@ ting Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ A . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open your temporary collection then exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this anim@@ ates me to further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ se@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Malaga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much spare time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone . I therefore want to emphasize that I only do more programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error notification or even a supporting email .
and of course my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the web , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you cannot of course hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s , TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned .
it is possible to save preferred links under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Defini@@ tive Play@@ list .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you select an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the cli@@ cked record .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you need to select the playlist from the playlist and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the Edit Mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation during start @-@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would bo@@ ther with the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ log ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the toolbar of S@@ MB . here you can see the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special video URL to YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
in order to always take a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ Players ) . before TV can be looked at , the used device and the TV channels need to be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in S@@ MB , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port is to be used . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR only supports X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , S@@ MB uses different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ y , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any hints on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as user root after attachment of the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom will show on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts up slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ st . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU .

G@@ opher menus are not standardized in so far as each G@@ opher server provides specific information .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; dump@@ ing .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be used on the package &amp; textile ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the dump ; -@@ website .
if you have any questions regarding or comp@@ iling &amp; boxes , please refer to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this easy , direct and custom access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex , must be called .
to learn more about &amp; Plac@@ ards ; and its possi@@ bil@@ ty to learn the manual on K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of posters ; start .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , it can also use a lay ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it originates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to control correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other mark@@ up languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that contains the most common features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text gray as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the \ \ end { document } command and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick entry Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document . you can also set some of the settings related to the document .
document classes : hereby the type of document to be created is selected : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; text &#93; &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , text &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this sets the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN provisions ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
with automatic failure of the surroundings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the box of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings box , ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and paragraph the bottom element ) :
when viewing the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex . once a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; dump ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer at the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and as soon as one element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it becomes the exact opposite . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer is spra@@ yed .
master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anywhere &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection boxes should be picked up . the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first choice box is for the quick insertion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box For further information is available for articles such as tags , foot@@ notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : this command will create a term for a section , a picture or a different item .
reference : is used for reference to a defined term ( selection box possible ) .
using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary editors necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files may also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ h@@ ape e is used for the definition of the font e . you can specify the font names for the main text , the foot@@ notes , etc . the following letters are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also occur later in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex has to be compiled . the simplest way to do this is the use of the menu building or the push of a button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; performs the storage automatically .
if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using Quick @-@ build , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font e 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } then allows the publication of the font e within the environment .
the changes are only supervised within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat printing , ital@@ ics , sub@@ cut@@ ters etc. can be added . these commands either end with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c pressure and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a proposition can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . for this , a quotation , a few passages in the fat and ital@@ ics pressure , and a poem will be applied to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a PDF file ; just try it and have fun .
DVI ; is a device independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ fond ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the legi@@ bility of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screen .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking a DVI , the document can then be printed out using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into other formats can begin by means of buttons in the toolbar .
the pre @-@ search function allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; binary files . only Modern can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Building Blocks can be selected .
to search for pre @-@ selection , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a row of the source code and then cli@@ cked on pre @-@ search . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
use this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should there be no error when using the Quick @-@ build DVI ; viewer , there may be an error . if there is an error , this will be briefly displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file tells the source code in the source code . in the editor , the fla@@ ws of the La@@ Te@@ X @-@ Er@@ r@@ ors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error can be used for jumps between the errors . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the defective line , the error in the log file must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the incorrect line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
loyal users of &amp; lat@@ ex , usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in &amp; Ki@@ le , to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex or file must be opened or a new file created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings can be adjusted .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created in a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for posters ; can be made directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to learn its possibilities , the manual on K@@ ate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can place there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of posters ; start .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called through the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex , and their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , when you click on the \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ a , only \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex works differ from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many wizard groups can add additional jump marks . this is a special kind of book@@ marks within the text . men@@ ue Edit jumping marks or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump mark is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offers outstanding possibilities , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has always been added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection .
choose a whole paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , there is not a text containing clear lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this is the only acceptable thing in &amp; box ; is that the sections are separated by two blank lines .
select the word below the current cursor position . this option also has an extended meaning , as this command also applies &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back partition ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex . that &apos;s why &amp; Ki@@ le offers ; for more orders under Edi@@ ting Environment for a more convenient work with &amp; lat@@ ex .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a number of ne@@ sted ambient orders , you can quickly lose sight of the remote view . this command completes the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from editing environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the welded bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded bracket .
if the cursor is on or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when input of many ne@@ sted group@@ ing braces can quickly be lost . this command completes the last open group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions are used as a guide . for the purpose implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple instructions . also for the ending of the application the sign &quot; is used . &quot;
this automatic insert of double quotes can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. au@@ german or French ) and therefore German or French quotation marks . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; enter key for &amp; Ki@@ le ; enter an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the \ \ item command .
enter the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added to Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the next line . although this tab does not like the corresponding line , add &amp; dump ; some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ s .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering a good source code completion , this has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; three different modes are installed . three of them work as needed and the other two are fully automatic . all these modes can be set up for different working modes under Settings ...
at the beginning a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } will begin &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and this is the result of the execution list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command . alternatively from &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jumps are added , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of ho@@ ck marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ st jump brand and the changed parameters can then be saved .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; can complete settings to these lists . there may be different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as wi@@ pers of the general language used .
command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there always have to be entered a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of the complete mode will have a large e list with environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for performing the environments .
when invo@@ king the complete environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . thereafter , the ambient remedi@@ ation can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the key .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... dump ; Complete can be made to these lists . this mode uses the complete list of the completed mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of items that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... Ki@@ le can be set up . as an example of a removal list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry is included , for example .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word wra@@ par@@ ound mode is opened over the volume editing or the key C@@ trl + Alt space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large emails are not helpful for automatic failure . however , it has been established that many offices are written more than once in a document . this offers &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete agreement for all already written offices .
this mode can be set up in the box settings box ... dump trucks can be switched off . here , also the threshold for displaying the complete damage can be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the per@@ s@@ able home folder .
the Graphics dialog is designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections and attention should be taken into account .
PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all the building tools are grouped together in the menus for compilation , converting and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for the viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by pressing alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be turned into a PS file by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick @-@ build command , a viewer is normally called after compilation . if no one @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is being asked about the project New Project . the following information is asked for the project :
when filling the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to run EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administr@@ ated over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = dump@@ s ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; they are delivered with many documents . they contain a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; boxes ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor , which can be installed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , which allows &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
much thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the progress of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use with regard to the &amp; GNU ; license . current information about the contribut@@ ors is available in the Help menu ber &amp; Ki@@ le ; .

&amp; C@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sign@@ atures for emails . with the command @-@ line interface , you create random sign@@ atures or daily sign@@ atures from a list . this command line interface provides the sign@@ atures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random sign@@ atures , any signature is selected from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read through many sign@@ atures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can make your emails varied and unique .
for daily sign@@ atures the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day use this to use different sign@@ atures , as with the random sign@@ atures create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this way you get an empty signature ; in the sign@@ atures section . if you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file save or click on the disk icon Save .

everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how superior it is . let &apos;s raise it a bit , give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML @-@ processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the ge@@ aring working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time Outlook is started .
as already stated , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the newly opened inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is opened , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .

specify the name of the file to be named as the result . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and don &apos;t have to wait until someone uses the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we start editing with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage all the included plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to locate the plug @-@ in .
often several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other on a project . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of one &apos;s identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . one example would be to record the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that inserts a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Event Con@@ configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , Events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . addressing can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter notes is simple . it may either select the Note entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax is @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the team member &apos;s nick@@ name .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around brackets and tags declare the comment invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta . this dialog runs through some pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this will be inserted immediately upon &amp; gt ;
not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and finish tag automatically : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the default button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here , however , will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be recovered from this backup in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be previ@@ ewed either in the Editor area or in its own view ( or documentation in a map section ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the windows settings back to the default value when the user interface has been mess@@ ed up by changing M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / dep@@ rec@@ ating views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message section is used to control the possibility of switching the display of warnings by check of no more .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source @-@ text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the representation of the Par@@ ser node in the document can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action executed by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Change settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree will be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document .
the area for setting abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that will un@@ fold when editing to larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ W abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plu@@ gins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any k@@ part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it &apos;s not located in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is given to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load the load . only read @-@ read parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . un@@ select allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely new . support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept has been implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins .
currently there is only one plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ U@@ I :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ts . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it normally .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session Star@@ ts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to de@@ duce a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to constantly send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without inform@@ ing information about the variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if the script is given , the execution begins when a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include items .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and proceed to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; Front @-@ end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which can be found on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . toolbar buttons are handy , symbol @-@ oriented tool@@ bars of image buttons ( above the editor window ) that insert text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the Properties dialog , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag shows . the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool tracks allow for quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a write error .
tag Fol@@ ders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag Fol@@ ders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to each other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
provides the source texts used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ ging % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag which groups the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
sets the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each one ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files is the Tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , verification only occurs when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag@@ XML file . this file describes a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file will be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load type type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D Editor DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = reference 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
an action can be created with Settings ... Cre@@ ate . click New Action to make the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking on the user @-@ defined button can be used to assign a short@@ cut ; K@@ 1 can be used to remove the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first you must specify the name of the script and the interpreter . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus attempts to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we replace the current document URL . in the case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods described above , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be used . in the selection field , input can be specified , which is to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the exported application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the standard output ; error messages , on the default output . it can be specified , what is to be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the drop down box output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings Action .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and , if the day has attributes and you are planning to use its use , enable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog if available , so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Show other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will mostly be interpreted as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be indicated that clicking this symbol will be a &amp; lt ; start@@ ed@@ ; tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , as there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the tool bar to the toolbar .
for example , I want to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar can believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure to the right folder . after New@@ e@@ X@@ HTML does not exist , it will be im@@ planted in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust their file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their toolbar ( s ) is loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first part we leave you , the second we treat you here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index top element = description for these documentation for example &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ tion@@ 1 = func@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
remember that the table directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that serves to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is indicated . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separated context elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners , or else to whom . at different points , there is an email @-@ sending menu item , like the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) sent by email , the tool@@ bars toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a child &apos;s entry we recommend to sign the resources , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . enter the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start up@@ loading by clicking OK .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool@@ bars toolbar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scrip@@ ting tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature . in case of problems it warns and it can be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D to a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that appears in the Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / ip ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be adjusted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction is concerned with a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbar buttons , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ g@@ allows the joint use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click on the tab with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with entries matching the current document , such as closing the current , other or all the file , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or run from CVS instructions to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor section lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cursor , or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . if you want a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and to ro@@ am through . in the representation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows the management of the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like Add , Rem@@ ove , Up@@ load or Del@@ ete the files from the storage media can be carried out using the context menu shown then .
a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , an entire website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and ref@@ res@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears beneath the other tree views . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development to be found . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the way to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H is in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only allowed to users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation can be found with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help k@@ help@@ desk help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being removed .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project folder , only one error will be reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there are converted special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Note , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
enables or dis@@ ables the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages out !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and switching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the location of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . that allows , for example , to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu when you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
this creates a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions need to be saved using Settings ... . tool rails are saved through toolbar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
remove a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or someone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; It makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder does not exist , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
this activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . inser@@ ting it by means of tool bar refuses to comply with the rules this day .
in the Plugins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on them . click on a activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or create un@@ graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode corresponding to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ g@@ gles the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , details can be found .
a dialog appears where you can delete or add entries from the toolbar and change the sequences .
this should generate a help corresponding to the mouse cursor &apos;s environment but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled the best from the top to the bottom , because , for example , after completing the project name , the entire directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except for processing local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ example .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , it does not tick .
with this option , all files and folders within the folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your choice .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the tick , exclude from the project .
the latest screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Profile or using the Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ cards possible ) that are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
up@@ loading profiles can be set up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for each profile &apos;s content for each profile by att@@ aching its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can enable event actions and add , modify or delete events . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as a file &apos;s backup . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar . open the Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files find . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , however , the opening and opening words are missing with ... in the context menu called in the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button del@@ etes to prevent removal .
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk is not stored .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving feature or a risk . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool tracks . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project tool@@ box in the Project or Project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own way of working .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , preferably stack@@ able via the toolbar . use and Ad@@ dition are different . adding tool@@ bars is discussed below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool bar ) , in which a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar can remove , ren@@ ame tool@@ bars or set toolbar buttons , which can be specified , which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for connecting . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file besides text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more special documents are ne@@ sted in corresponding sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl @-@ based . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As a template save as local template .
once this has been done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template file under project templates .
select text in your document and click File save as template save option as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged and put on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project files you can click on a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and backup . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very pur@@ pos@@ eful approach . you can pre@@ tend header lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically linking with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the template sub@@ window is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes are adverti@@ sed .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder .
allows leading or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for a whole presentation already with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
additionally , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit , the source editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . with pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the key press moves the active cursor from one window to the other , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... Accor@@ ding to V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small gap for fast calcul@@ ators and a large gap for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select document properties . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the d@@ ash encoding . this can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information on the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves like usual . the marking works as usual .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some toolbar functions such as the tables wizard or the list assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used in this release .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for studying style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet style can be followed .
to compile successfully , you need out &amp; k@@ de ; libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned support points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame with no path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style file name with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g work folder . for example , a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a preceding named my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a specified rule name will be checked . template matches with any QNA@@ P@@ cloud that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNA@@ P@@ cloud &quot; is extended by the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired stop point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stopping points are checked again shortly after starting each iter@@ ation .

several commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass compound phrases as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a stop point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the merge and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way connection is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you comparing and merging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines are only differentiated in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other one is different in one line then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o Dest@@ ination folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ der 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Dest@@ ination folders
the Open dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog will remember your selection and display it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is done with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merging of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , however for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field will be active for target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to set up an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Setup knob opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before starting the merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare an entire file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , upload them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at present you can &apos;t get anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the Info line . the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that is good in the next section ( merging ) well .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is represented on the broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an Info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; modi@@ fying &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump to the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing ; no row in the queue ; displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and maybe yet again select another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a selection that you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the Text &amp; lt ; Conf@@ lic@@ t Conf@@ lic@@ t ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , side , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the Au@@ ction window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary column synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the compilation and edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / first / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Image Ab@@ wards ) or to the next / last un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you must press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . however , be careful with this option because you may acci@@ dentally over@@ write the clip@@ board contents .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + new@@ line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps track of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at exit and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered stream@@ lined . on these systems , the pres@@ ets button automatically sets an un@@ just color .
when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tab@@ ul@@ ator button is pressed . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you press input or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each option is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy the manual to the clip@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 attempts to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step is compared to each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . even when merging white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the carriage return signs may look identical , but like a white mark . during merging this option has to be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; n &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless shown , but they are treated as white characters .
this option is down@@ lighted in the default . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in pres@@ etting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Automati@@ cally Advanced mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue .
automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge operation . look for details under documentation to compare and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
customize the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to activate the change . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following code settings can be set for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
above the selection fields for encoding , a short notice appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
customize file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you edited a file , you can specify which coding to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
turn off this to supp@@ ress dup@@ lication of changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded overview column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply exit the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
subordin@@ ate the comparison window to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge operation and uses the file name of the last source file as the default file name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that meets your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processing command . the output of the command is only used for line comparison . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ fix for line comparison to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an ar@@ du@@ ous expression of the found text in the first bracket . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same $ keyword generated text $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you might even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ S@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processor for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hit is replaced by nothing , thus virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / er@@ Ex@@ p / er@@ set / er@@ aser &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . further operations will only change the data that the line comparison algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre @-@ processor sees the output of the normal processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the merging and displays the simulated changes without really performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no destination folder is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge . to start merging , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder , a small message window informs about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that were then compared are listed .
when the scan of the folders is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded down . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the item or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories fold up and unlock all sub@@ directories with which you can open or un@@ fold all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of problems of this kind again .
as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started .
synchron@@ izing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folders have been specified and if the option Synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file is selected instead of merging ( unsure ) is enabled , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not removed , the merging of the folders cannot be started .
while merging , a file is executed after the other . status column shows ready when merging has been successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if merging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all in order .
if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the matching actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , C will be used as the target in the Three Fol@@ der M@@ erg@@ ing mode , B will be chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current item , select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merging actions , a message appears that indicates the faulty item . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Browse , Sim@@ ulations and Canc@@ el options .
select Sim@@ ulations if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select again start / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue with the next entry .
at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to solve the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging .
if some entries have been combined individually , see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later merging of all entries . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; directory merging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these options : &quot; &quot; &quot;
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( for example * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a preceding point marks a file hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
links to files : when the option is turned off , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links display . this is down@@ lighted in default .
links to folders : when the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and searched for recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 does not check for possible recur@@ sions .
complete analysis of each file and displays the stati@@ stic columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the date of change and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
similar to the Date Modi@@ fying Date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , if the modification date has been lost . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the later file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is assumed that the other file was not changed too . ) This option is turned off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version is renamed and ob@@ tains the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension exists , then it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the folder merging view remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch off the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want that , you can switch the Directory &amp; Text window to the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views .
you can also directly merge a file by double @-@ clicking . however , you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder . to do this , use the current file merge from the merge menu .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or modification date . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( please refer to the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Def@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 assumes that the input file is a unified file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to recover the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing files is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compact ) already exist . in addition , the name K@@ S@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool @-@ Collection .
I use GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or get it like that .
you compiled the program from sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . configure the configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines , next to each other , this description is the case .
the editor notes itself for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text suddenly appears ; no sr@@ c has been left , and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ us@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir Speci@@ fies the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
there &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of them .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) copies into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . inser@@ ting ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift Past@@ ing ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
only display differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . )
only entries that show differences are displayed . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge operation . ( the behavior is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the A , B and C label below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking the button accordingly .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . far@@ ew@@ ells in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both within a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , Windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager ... and Be@@ aming . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as entries minimize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands effect the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when a application has been cli@@ cked .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed along with the name , the names will be marked with numbers , eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is enabled , the running programs are shown as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid appear , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical line in a vertical line , which is very well suited for viewing on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as icons or with their contents .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switch settings ... lets the dialog appear .
currently this can not be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . If you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must log in as a user root or turn to your system administrator .
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of K@@ DE basic packages .

this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag , shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged pane of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can show &amp; Cold ; to do this , make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop down mode ) or the area of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to see the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fication window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
in addition , press the &amp; Shift ; press key or push the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the drop @-@ down menu .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy to a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to insert it into other applications later ) , rotate the image and more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to turn to 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your default short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button Document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Canc@@ el &amp; etc ; .
K@@ possibly also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from resear@@ ching or artist to web designer or visual disabled .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the repe@@ ating Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and can em@@ ulate pain for every mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the mere moving of your mouse . if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that occurs when clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and execute a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
if the intelligent push @-@ button is activated , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent pushing requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click will execute .
if Intel@@ lig@@ ently Move is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , after dra@@ gging the mouse button , wait before it release the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse is done .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click by mouse shift . if this feature is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system there and here the Reiter General . there is a slider sound buff@@ ers that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . with G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the last press release .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not display a link does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take the mouse out . as this happens , mouse is mouse to mouse . it should be clear , however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or a f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when an im@@ position has just begun . if you use the intelligent push @-@ button in this case , that means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute even a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . however , you can park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , a acci@@ dentally mouse click can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar buttons and menus and the tit@@ le@@ rows of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent moving is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can deal with it . it is very well possible to mark the text , copy it to the clip@@ board and then insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
don &apos;t use the smart move if you just start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it . select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key down while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this makes every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shutter speed starts when the intelligent move starts . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers , and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and causing pain to be pressed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program where silent users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history phrases that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) you enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text box . from the text passages you can often choose the text passages used without typing them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for word @-@ life . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can match the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains in essence an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your movements ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you mouth ; right , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken movement is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date . you can select phrases you want to speak again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ converting and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the learning flash@@ cards , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the selection field under the input field , specify the character encoding when the text is passed to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . see App@@ endi@@ x for examples .
if that is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ser@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first choice field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages or in the list for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages the selected text passage is spoken directly and inserted in addition to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for the Text passages manual , you can specify whether the text message book should be saved automatically when the editing window is closed .
save the book with the selection of Text passages . if you choose to reject any changes , the text box book is not saved . select Before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text message book is to be saved .
in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word @-@ life .
with the buttons to the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply retri@@ eved by counting the assignment . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , generate a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of the text or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
actions like new passages or books add or select selected text passages and books , you can either reach by selecting in the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise select the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise select the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise select the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar is arranged by default through the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar is displayed for text fit books with entries . by default , the toolbar is located directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card &apos;s voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a speech @-@ edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use festival free of charge and without further propag@@ ation .
to show an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without further propag@@ ation .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eware folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swallow the last character of the text , so an additional sign has to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo $ ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ st / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option must be turned on as standard input .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the language generator can only be configured in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ser@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to Settings , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot speak , print text from the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored which can be used by the user over and over again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ acc@@ mailing list . subscribe to the list above ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ vi@@ d.@@ The developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ c ) .
before you can use it , you need to install and adjust the speech speech program . see also
at the first start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as there is no speaker set up , the card @-@ card speaker is shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card is displayed in General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the default speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ears for the same printer .
when you click on the cart@@ on @-@ card @-@ tra@@ der in kt@@ ap@@ m@@ gr , the card @-@ card speaker will be shown . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ yo@@ m@@ gr and no speaker has been set up yet .
all the speakers already set appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a single mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a single mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a single mouse click and click this button to push the speaker down one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list will also determine their priority .

choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to make the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language delivery system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start succ@@ eeds , the card message is displayed , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , Proc@@ t@@ ts is running ; further , if the field output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control strip , it disappears again as soon as the read @-@ read is complete .
the buttons in this series allow you to start , cancel , pause , and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can pre @-@ read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages .
the card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General and En@@ able Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that is to be read and select Text to read in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that is to be read and select Text to read in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works if &amp; Plac@@ ards ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; which noti@@ fies you of events that you specify . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu item appears noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as this can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
words are edited in filters before being sent to the speech speech program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the speech program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts .
the display of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the display of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the sustained orders are resum@@ ed .
warning has the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed following the issue of warning .
news have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you read &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . every order that you inf@@ use by the card pass is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such read , this output is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
string translators replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string substitute filters that allow replacing chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ S@@ LT files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have a female voice on the card @-@ card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is used for voice output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , the text remains unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the set @-@ up normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following entries will be shown below .
for setting up string statement filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker is speaking one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl @-@ key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs can be obtained using the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copies .
the string replacement filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if identical . if all input fields are empty , the filter will apply to all text .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will not find a manual for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the c@@ ess@@ ti@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former Trans@@ former &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
the speaker selection filter lets you send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the voice characteristics that the program displays , the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speakers created on the card board . you can over@@ ride the chosen speaker with the speaker selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . if installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access it with a click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the subscri@@ ber you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the speaker selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must add at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the speech output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ap@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is the text of the text to read and select a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , please
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Windows . only start kt@@ ap@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ mu@@ d@@ gr in the other .
none of the above syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
I set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ formed filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found through the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing @-@ cat@@ fish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be corrected by a string release filter . see .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a single &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information that is not yet contained in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of any other syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a new development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including k@@ deli@@ bs pack@@ ets and development files for the &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program .
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ vi@@ d or downloaded the tar@@ ball created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you start &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if speech speech with your speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly . you can use the shell script of the SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops used by the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility should be developed so that the use of speech tools is directly possible and that the SPD @-@ conf file is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sentences . the user can return sentence or paragraph style , repeat , stop or cancel the issue .
if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is female and whose sex is female , this will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker is automatically selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in .
if you click Add to Ad@@ dition on the card message board , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the box ID device setup will be displayed . for example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details of the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you just have to enter festival .
select the string encoding for text that is passed to the festival . if voices , the kt@@ ts are known , this setting will be done automatically . generally , Western languages will use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sliding controls , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the syn@@ thes@@ ized language . if you cannot select some of the controls and display this gray , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized quicker .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be shown at the start of kt@@ ap@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol kt@@ ap@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is checked and kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the read @-@ up .
here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . the ID ID corresponds to the ID column ID of the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can move forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ap@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed . screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of kt@@ ts , see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been started &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or kt@@ ops ; the necessary libraries can not load .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50 nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ cc , about twice the normal speaking speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to App@@ ly the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech applications :
the display of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the screen reader is read , the queu@@ ed orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you read &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message are active , the introductory note is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this card pass are valid only for normal text orders . for news , warnings and the spending of screen readers there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy news , run kt@@ ap@@ m@@ gr and click Al@@ erts . the card message noti@@ fications appear .
select this check box to enable the read @-@ out of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; don &apos;t read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications for which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts , will not be read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message that &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; ma@@ iled when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &apos;s to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the speaker that you want . default chooses the speaker listed in the list on the card speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All notices for application Def@@ ault ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the notification settings as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the Lo@@ ad button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as it is the default voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds divide text into single sentences . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts to start faster with the read @-@ read , since only the first set needs to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you can see the by@@ te recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of by@@ te recognition filters is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add any other by@@ te recognition filter , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the simplest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speakers selection and enter text to read . switch on the choice of speakers , change some properties and check how the choice of speaker is changed . to do this , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then faster with the read @-@ read can start , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function , you can execute text orders on the card card .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ ap@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
by@@ te recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ulation signs are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard by@@ te recognition filter keeps the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ itt@@ ens ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the standard by@@ te recognition filter from hiding , you can insert it by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the card selection list , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application .
use of the default speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words , no speaker features are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker that has all the characteristics of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the speaker you want . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only thing you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a certain application sends text in a different language than the specified in the working environment .
to delete all the properties in the area of speaker that corresponds best to the following , click the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case 0 for the last word order is in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ap@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it &apos;s started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back trac@@ ing .
G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and kt@@ ops ; it has been terminated . G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x will probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer may be installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
in your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA are occurring that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it at festival , but kt@@ ri@@ m@@ gr will not show this voice .
please add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ v / t@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ l / bind . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card audio card there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer even on the card card for speaker setting a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting from &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML transform@@ ers filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that Festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects SS@@ ML according to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string statement filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no longer be pre@@ - or backward . on the map hand@@ ler jobs is displayed , the order exists only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for a set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks instead .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and let a text read . furthermore , if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read even more .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of speech speed , but it is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you been downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . go to this folder and enter the following commands :

the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure option to switch off the display indicates the configure parameter that causes the passing of creation .
default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not specified in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify the --@@ pre@@ fix option . for example
on Deb@@ ian systems / usr / local is the right directory for programs translated from sources .
echo figur@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd Proc@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of voices is generally good and there are multiple voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software at festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phones . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding flag must be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Syn@@ thesizer . then , Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from the di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded .

this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ --@@ package has been designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ ad@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ --@@ the device at all and allows the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers will be charged for network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be identified , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by checking the setting non @-@ re @-@ questions the setting can be set permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
the full functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three riders :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button interface ... set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options .
by selecting Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
the manual can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field net@@ mask the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as needed . switching off an off network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . switching off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if more than one network interface is present on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator named part of the name resolution module allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be re @-@ ranked by selecting an entry and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons exec@@ uting or her@@ ding in priority .
by clicking the Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... You will see the Edit dialog .
the list named above describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually , the list of names known by name contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the review of IP should replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the familiar host@@ name and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known host has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Know@@ ing hosts will be shown .
you can perform one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ --@@ is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are needed .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ --@@ alter@@ able configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) are currently being used . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 expects that it will continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person who uses a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 70 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the host ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ --@@ and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is acci@@ dentally re @-@ sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which in addition offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective pack .
before a tape can be used , it must be included in &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; returns the band and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the pre@@ p on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the default pin searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the Status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by opening the tape for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to see that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape type must be format@@ ted before you can use it to save data . if your tape drive requires that a tape needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must be done before you can format the tape before use . flo@@ ppy drives generally do not require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity &amp; k@@ dat , continue with the tape format@@ ting . all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be saved , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save Menu ...
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog opens up Settings for Backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the Save dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will display settings for check . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the check .
if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will display settings for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will restart . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index in two ways from the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be saved will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up that are on the same file system as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be listed separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
exec@@ uting an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files has not yet been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variation of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . it may not work for all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , it is automatically dis@@ car@@ ded when un@@ locking the &amp; k@@ dat file . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Log@@ s . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions that can filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , sy@@ slo@@ g server format and Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions for easy filtering and sorting of each log file of a log file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ systematic log ; first try to open the main protocol file of the system - the system log . if this is not shown , and it opens instead of a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ systematic log ; most probably do not have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log directory , for normal users .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or string . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so that only log rows are displayed that fit to the selected filter . in the default setting , the drop @-@ down menu will only display all of them . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only to the entries in the correspon@@ dingly selected column . for example , select the process column in the log file system log , and enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , so you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . level Error log lines are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than Protocol lines of level hint . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched on setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new log lines .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; allows displaying multiple log files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the pop @-@ up menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org where you can find more information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ systematic log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the System V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for monitoring program starts when the system starts up in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and format@@ ting . the Linux kernel first looks at / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc rather than directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to boot when running the system or when you switch to another run@@ way . system services include such things as Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial that is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
if you need it , r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places and starts the first one it finds .
the standard running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the beginning a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you &apos;ll come to fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : every script is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people would like a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ way running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ way , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand tool is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ way to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . thereby , the entry is removed from its original run@@ way ( or its position ) .
note : entries are moved if you drag them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ way , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore records thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the various work@@ spaces ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection over@@ - or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another run@@ way , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ way with insert ( with C@@ trl + V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press Enter to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ n , and now the machine is rest@@ art@@ ing continuously . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard run@@ way to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution at Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that exist only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distri@@ butions but is unfortunately not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available , which are needed by the respective system service ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) just end without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ way so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading .
after you make changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save button in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled wild@@ card ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card pass is created where you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card file password management will appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if at least one embedded file system constra@@ int ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable from the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space restrictions are given in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with space restriction .
the Groups menu provides information about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the right add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or selected group works analog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove , and modify the boot password , change the time to boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , modify operating systems , remove , modify and more .
