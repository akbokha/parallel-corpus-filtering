<seg id="1">You can translate the module website in the & konqueror; menu under Extras page. select the source and destination language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated to the location of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and, in the worst case, nonsense. therefore, translations do not make important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page by themselves, where you can insert texts to be translated directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions... Open the map tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard package modules from package kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror, before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Extras Cancel. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module anser filter (also called Folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentate, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily detected if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of & UNIX; command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. to simplify navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over the View color mode can either display depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file feature such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if sufficient space is available for display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (whereby the display error can occur by limitations on the character of the treemap). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. this target is not always observed. parameters are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and this framework needs space that is then no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How divided the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always possible to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles arise which are as square as possible. the best methods in this are lines, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the View menu item View on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the KCachegrass application.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "the" "" "Image Gallery" "" "can be found in the & konqueror; menu in Tools View picture gallery... or with Ctrl + I." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the gallery gallery, a dialog opens up which allows you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a script to adjust the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="34">Using the comment field check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings gives you easy access to general & HTML; Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu in the navigation pane, or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation area; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser identifier adds a menu entry in & konqueror, which allows you to change browser and operating system identifier for individual domains. this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identification of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Conqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser identification to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser identification to access the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digicam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicam; contains a fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use this to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing skills can easily be expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works fully in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, they should report trouble and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you are using these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all required information is already registered here. follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicam; is a project supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we encourage you to join the user mailinglist of & digikam; join. you can ask here questions to other users of & digicam; in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to learn about shared releases and other information about & digicam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to take part in & digicam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instruction to login to the developer mailing list of & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you have digicam; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path names or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digicam; will additionally be used as an Albenbibliothek. customize digikam collections collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as base folder. & digicam; looks at any subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the search of the folder, you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicam; During recursively reads the library path in its full depth. you can't exclude subfolders unless it is hidden in hidden folder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put them on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up in & digicam; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Record button to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Shell Backup: if you use the blank mode of your camera, it can also handle it. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh decoder settings and raw workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digicam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 oder i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a disk device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivates. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmits over the serial port are slow, this connection has become outdated. & digicam; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the preview images of digicam can be retrieved reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things in & digicam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digicam;, Photoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier to digicode; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes have been digitized; self.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can choose either side bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the alame tree, via the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be dropped into keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selector allows you to figure out the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are displayed in the symbol view currently. thus, filtering on the filename works only if it is shown in the symbol view. which fields are displayed you can configure in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select Album Importate screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the pop-up menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to right click on the album and select album properties on the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can group them under a common name. the collection you put is used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete new collections. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the Settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: will be used if you sort your albums by date with View records sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Eldest, average, New ester: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & edited, the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlipiquot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As the album preview, select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album on the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the pictures in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait for a moment while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all preview images.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the associated preview. what information these are can be edited through Settings | Settings. select here the albums page and customize the area thumbnails to your liking.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help buttons that appear. the help shows the most important properties including all the key features of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the Introduction in the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about digicam; go. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to them. you can choose between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 Image Edit... or the context menu of the image with right mouse button and edit... select. in section digicam; Image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digicam; the functionality you need is not provided. you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. to do this, and how to customize them to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, it is possible to avoid problems with the metadata contained in the picture. some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click on the preview and select Dreams. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you have a photo taken from & digikam, it will be moved to the trash bin of & kde; move. F8 image Delete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete, you can do this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My date List; organizes your photos based on the data. & digicam; uses either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the calendar view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are provided by a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by this you can logically organize your keywords. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword lipiquot; so that you can easily find the key words you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword; or click an existing keyword and then select Create Create. if you have a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the option to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right clicking it and editing the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album on the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use it's functionality with keywords, you first have to add your photos with keyword. this can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to add with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword. alternatively, you can also right click on the preview of the pictures and choose from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to him. in this way, you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have a photo with keyword, this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the keywords menu. the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The Timeline View displays a time-dependent adjusted histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame you just have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection box indicating the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps, and even more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds matches. if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp will rot.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you typed as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your choice, press OK and the Search will be performed. the results are displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the form will return to search again with the previously entered search information. if you select as advanced search, the dialog will appear for the extended search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Clear Search in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digicam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are displayed line-wise, separated by operators. any option can be associated with others about the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... You can create searches of the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar. by means of a swellert, the result selection can be enlarged or decreased. if you slide a picture from somewhere on the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hand-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; find the appropriate pictures. also here, a threshold can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Mini Program. press the mouse wheel or zoom out or hold it and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this implies, of course, that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this is then added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live geocache.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides a lamp table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Lightable from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened. if you are back in the & digicam; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select a preview from the toolbar and perform zoos or move operations on one of the images, then these are also executed in the other image. you can therefore compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use combination mode from the toolbar, then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison. now, use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it in the right pane.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal deletions work directly from the beam table, like F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to pivot the visible area of the image, you have to click on them and hold the & LMB; in Mode Preview, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom functions as well as in other views. just use the zoom slider below the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the buzzword? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos receivables, scans or stores digital photos carries out a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect, protect, convert, group, backup, evaluate, categorize, backup, review, sample, archive, optimize, maintain and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, seeks, transformed, confectioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is based on your definition data, which provides information about or documentation of other data, which are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you do not need to take stock management for longer a certain photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have then use certainly not & digikam;. the approach to store metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether other access to your photos should have, whether you want to save them to a network drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend saving the metadata in the editing page of the metadata in & digikam; to enable it. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this then you can later save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to add & edited a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign keywords, captions and a rating to each photo. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's continue with keywords, keywords, as you often see in other programs, or Categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued pictures from another source with embedded keyword, then & digicam; automatically build the tree for you or add the images to the right place. converting the tree within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drawing a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is a very rough representation since every block of metadata is in truth out of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let anyone know your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance, there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing stage of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, having associations, memories, the historical period of time is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer, to help Him over the motive that has moved you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as caption. if you export your images to web galleries, then these captions are exported to your specifications in the caption and / or title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to navigate to another city without a navigation system? wasn't it a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now works with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually review your trips using pictures with geographic information. & digicam; can also export the photos to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps beholder.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the set page of & digicam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title: associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's work name. examples of this may be titles such as: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify this, in the picture. for private individuals, this protection is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & nbsp; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, current violations, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, asterase prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, this cautious approach must be dealt with and you can't wait longer than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & Dollars; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the correct way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if they have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CD and DVDs, there's a cheap program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs on Windows and & Linux; but is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs, of course also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriety format. then read the data again to check you. also, you should copy the media with a description, date & author and then copy it to a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to transfer the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your stats for themselves. their manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks keep the longest if you operate in the Temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. with lower annealing the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure. SMART errors indicate the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices don't matter much, it looks different for devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug connector.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, please ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be aware that all peripheral devices connected to your system may also be protected by this. some manufacturers provide overvoltage spouts, which also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it may be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models even allow them to continue to work until the current is running again. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the provided software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of power problems with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to 20 euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than 20 euro; at the end, you should always remember to keep all cables before you go on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can integrate it as your drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as your backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are at home in comparison to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. thanks to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically adjusted and in the large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs provide at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. it's quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one ever seems to have thought about it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss since they generate intersms within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrf filesystem. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that ZFS is using and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than for example thefts or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; nobody has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS, and XFS to name the common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden breakdown during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture setting of fundamental physical borders. meaning that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to get worse. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so make no one responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss. so, backup your data frequently on a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes you're lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. don't forget: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desaster prevention always means not local storage. bring up your backups the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made. this backup comes with an versioning system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come up with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, original memory, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unforeseeable on the basis of your nature, you must consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way than to forge a certain vigilance. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional impression of the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record has been detected by the system, but don't impose it on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb / sdb / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb / sdb.</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not exist any software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (delate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open blank image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed because of the need to standardize the camera image formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use Canon and Nikon's competitor.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why to replace 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot;, a mix of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive the original of your photo, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits because it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can lead to problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard compounds and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera editor, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert the raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digicam; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these may be truncated by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in web galleries, encoding them in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicam; to get. in the Adding a photos to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, connect them to your computer, switch the camera to the display mode and switch on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a ready indicator appears at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file allocation are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">This information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your machine is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digicam;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures are securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the selected using the standard selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download the selected button. the button selected can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these pictures have not yet been edited by & digikam; downloaded. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the Show all or download Selected Show, a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of the existing albums is shown, as usual folder. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & edited; load the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete All Delete button. if you only want to delete some, you must select it first and then delete AusModified deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore photos you deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a digicam; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera completely, you should do so via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use descriptive names for the photos. the filenames are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you upload photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for data-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options which are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the exif information in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% d% H% H:% M:% S in the editing field. turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments you should read the strftime help.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option Camera file name, you have the option to change the filenames in lowercase. or in capital letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digicam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the point of time recording to perform automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the page strip metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, it can be digitised; the photo in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, it can be used to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case save & digicam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based baskets at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your machine to your camera is the Download button. then select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, ask & digicam; you know where the pictures are to be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog for the camera will appear. select here the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the data can be processed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architects offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser showing the area. if you want to send a postcard to another location, or want to send a user who can locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that it supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailers and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transfer of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gps1 or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic allocation.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the callsign indented coordinates, which are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicam; tries to give you as much control over its operations as possible. there are many settings that modify the behavior of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you need to edit in the Settings menu; set up. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digicam; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the appropriate IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface. even with a database synchronization, these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's title: this field should contain the photographer's professional title. this can be labels such as hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as they offer the picture to others & quot; if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC Felders.This ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of digicam;. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in & digicam; without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images saved as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the captions embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests in the main window above a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicam; display tries, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Each time you open the lighting table these settings are switched on. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole picture size, you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in picture editing, this view mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-files option you can toggle the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">If you select the lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossless setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of digicam; image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. at present, it quickly evolved into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if the rendered green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance, which is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the peak lights in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the cutting lights, so the parts of your images that are burned are, due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights, as a continuous whitening. the setting colors will trigger some unusual results, since they can reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & redressed; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not satisfied blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When selecting the reconstruct option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should be individually adjusted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">You probably have to set it higher than standard 1. however, this can be done later in the editing options of the & digicam; image editing. to keep the time for the demolition small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color-structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Drappers provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenous Directed) was the first algorithm used by Drapin. it creates color artefacts at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction, as it is performed during shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digicam; information such as colour information from one color space to translate to the other so the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / Start colour management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile Folders Set the folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC-Profiles You have here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon, which do not include color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate on how your image would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you print a picture as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated. you could manually correct this instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obvious which color profile is intended for. unfortunately not on the models from Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the destination: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by delivering this interface can & digicam; many modules that were written to work with any program supporting the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and they are then loaded by & digikam; loaded. these modules appear as new entries in the main window's menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">"" "short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the" "" "Quick instructions" "" "menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switch the metadata to or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all currently supported cameras on the left side. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. below are the port settings. currently, Serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 oder i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you will need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try whether & digicam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the main window's cameras. if you own more than one camera, you can insert them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving images in the trash bin, you can set the conversation of & digicam; when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections Delete a photo and delete an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be tacitly used by & digikam; used if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you must save the changes using the Edit button.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen of & digicam; disable when starting. this will speed up the start of the digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The Setting Start after new photos was forcing & edited; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extended the start time of & digicam;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, ask & digicam; you, if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digicam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicam; includes a fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use this to view and correct your photos and to edit and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting View / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digicam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see the section Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used the Save or Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with File Save as executed.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore button from the File menu or use the button The Restore the image processing button in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Modify or Restore editing by selecting Edit Reproduce from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -switch-Z to recover.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the picture editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in that you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarger Factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you will get to the normal view by using the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can see this in the setting dialog of & digikam; change.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; printing dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences. you just have to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Exportate Digital Assistant. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicam; main window has a sidebar on the right side which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should note these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, either use the button Apply or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to rate multiple images at the same time, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword-word and a box with the keywords used previously in this digicam; -session used keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly narrow down the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification when entering keywords for a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords may also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of the shown pictures in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, date, keyword and search. if additionally one or more keywordfilters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword has been drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled in settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the rules section.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & edited; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web will correspond to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results they want. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other images are e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone, why should I use another color space and then have to worry about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calliate my monitor when I chose to work in a sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB is plugging the circle. if you work as in the color space of sRGB, then you either need to connect your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, please use it before you try further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Figures, Automatically Figures and Contrast extension from the menu Correcting Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminance values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel gets as flat as possible. sometimes the equivalent results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either generates miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a newcomer to all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool to do the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">If you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correcting will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Colors White Balance of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance, then click the subwindow to click.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadow calibration lets you improve or downgrade the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the Preferences panel. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The preset button resets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save these settings, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed picture here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time, and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be done through the subwindow for brightness. detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted from the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under color sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously, so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digicam; the colour effects tool provides you with four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, was an effect that arose when a partially developed pressure applied to a short flash light and afterwards the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter parts were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia's name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it the film of choice for wildlife photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level parameter controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photo. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma the tool is based on sound correction for improvement of exposure. even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide for the application described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three slides are clicked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the knob to make sure the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically using the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the uppermost for the dark tones, the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinboards can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. for example, the output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for any shade, medium and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">Half of the original and the target image will be displayed on the left side. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows the channel specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most meaningful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short part to the right, e.g. the bright notes, you can see that these bright notes correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">You can see a red marker on the preview of the original photo. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and then loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow-, mid- and sun shades. check the color pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">"" "the" "" "channel blender" "" "of the & digicam; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo." ""</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly developed tool to mix the tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel blender of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for histogram: this gives you a first indication as you can correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison over your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminanz, the picture will also retain the general brightness as the channel blender then is THE tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color will result in a visible noise coming from the color space. if this is the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any blender set can be saved for later and then loaded. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can be converted easily on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. thus, like the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, like the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of day. thus, like the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shade tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and redevelopment in a Sepiatonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of magnified points or as a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the impression of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) can be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image. thoroughly surrounding the image with a colored line, niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttoned effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously used.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into an image at any place. this can also be done in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it using the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the" "" "OK" "" "button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; apply tool stencil you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Menu picture template used in image editing can be used to lay templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the digicam; templates database, simply send an email in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the Device base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the templates files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder refreshes the preview pane of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">It is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpness is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image sharper. actually, it does not work a bit, it works rather audiovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitalisation process colours with only minimal differences to one color point. this in turn leads to blurred edges. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness already while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this can be done using the menu item Corrigid Follow.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a bit softly is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for softness with the menu entry Correcise softness and experiment with some settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the sharpness mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates are generated close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore, you should sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. this makes it possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with soft switching between tones are excluded and therefore beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filtering. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2).</seg>
<seg id="496">The digicam; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted filtering algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'sche fold. the Gauss sian fold has a very long tail, which means that the mathematical result also depends on the swelling pixies that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna inverse of the Gauss curve is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the standard value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values close 1, eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise Filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. the filter can take values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0,03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 'sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness Gauß' is. this is most often caused by a previously performed blur filter. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge. note, however, that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to make all blanks, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that lots of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but will later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, eg. than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by pinching a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal lens filter. practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the sharpest mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob tightens the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tints allow a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inlegal algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings finer you can use the tabs smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. please note that no sharpening should always be subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes uniformly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film graining or CCD hiss will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how many times the algorithm is passed. normally, one or two is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-step-width da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral increment in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal. however, it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors corrected is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected using small artifacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the trip.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; -Effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be removed successfully using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter uses per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors corrected.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel gap to the front of the filter to determine luminance changes. if it is raised, the noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer obtain and noise or lubricate occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the filter's frequency response. if it is too strong, it is not possible to remove all roughness or noise peaks. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artifacts without loosing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more roughed up. however, it also sums up the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phase absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges. it can remove roughspikes and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be saved to the file system and then loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is labeled with (1) and the corrected one (2). noise reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little bit softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften with the menu entry Correcise softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or retrofitted digitized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG compression artifacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far away. as a loss-prone compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; artefacts quot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected one under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old colour photo that was scanned using a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Das & digikam; Tool Hotpixel allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Light, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality rough-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button Dark Image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you connect the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defilements.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixels. note that the Wizard will remember the last dark image and automatically reload it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an intersection of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for one-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubical surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction applied on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image can be seen under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo formats, often cannot light the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignettiererquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">There are also disadvantages. many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which means that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should, even with center filters, use an opening of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise the sharpness effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's films and the grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image without this filter.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity adjustment at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or by chance a luminance of 2.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image using the vignetting correct reduces the brightness of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options. the controls only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine re-adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting grading applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens bias is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, but flatters at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth degree corrects the remote corners opposed to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion-fourth degree. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the inverse insignia of the parameter in general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus corrects first grades. negative values increase while positive image resizes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview of the distortion Correction is illustrated. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values next time.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. if you re-cut an image and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would seem obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to view the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu Select slicing from image editing or via Zoom Customers of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives like shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red film of the Gimpanze.org website which is accessible via this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set of film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add Film Punishment if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green lawns are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture under (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in peak lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicam; Filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your images. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix big silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postpone into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO-sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smoothing controls the smoothing or, from the other side, looks at the artiseness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digging; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images of their gradients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch out. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller adjusts the pin size and the bottom adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digicam; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">It works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to wave blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to be computed and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unity: blurts the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixel around a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurts the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photos, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blurred the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton's effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness sharpness: blurts the image through random shifting of the pixels and thereby simulates the sharpness of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the paint tank in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to be computed and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops to your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the digicam; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops Filters. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can fix it by mirroring or turning into the correct orientation.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blocker is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and hold the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you retrieve the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size using a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to increase an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bloated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the new size aspect ratio is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly to do so. enlarge each listing for photo can be saved as a text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo blocker is very fast with what it does, but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo-bubbles by magnifying a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you just need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo is cut away. this gives you a good overview how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply clicking the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Random button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl + + X). use the Save or File menu entries under the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the following aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the higher value of height and width is always assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cut the tool After aspect ratio use a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The encoding help settings allow you to hide help so that you can better put your images together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-wing rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into a similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mean: the golden mean is a division based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden mean.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden mean provides more liquid resource lines if you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos to achieve your goal. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called gold rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that directs the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral, discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not a triangular triangles. diagonal to these lines can be seen a static object of dynamism.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try placing your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Mirror and Vertical Options can be used to mirror the harmonic dividends.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digicam; image editing and the tool free rotation. select Transformation Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the presets button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function transformieren selections from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is to cut the function Automatically. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. but please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Turning right up: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes blurred. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you will get unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformer cutting from the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformieren scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help a vertical and a horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the adjustment tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you've done the lubrication, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shear, this effect is mostly negligible, but two scrapers produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformer cutting from the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with & digicam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digicam; shows only files in formats that know it. this is done based on file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is specified in the list, the file can be edited in the editing pane. you can change this list of file extensions to digicam; be accepted. in the configuration section you will find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s release can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert Raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; in the configuration section you will find more information on how to use modules with & digicam;.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program used for viewing & graphviz; dot; graphene. the & graphviz programs are used in science, especially in computer science. previously there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz; include, are according to the program author outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraph viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well-built & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraph viewer; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well-integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Placement; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & posters; recomputes the graph and shows in & kgraph viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & Placards; to open or graph in & kgraph viewer; in a & Placement; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting about 1000 knot and a hack to present more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraph viewer; without launching an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file, and the (empty) list of Restored files. click on the first icon to view the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; -files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file is changed from another program, the following window will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; can also remember your decision, so you can change your decision later. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu option kgraph viewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside of a running & kputviewer; instance open, eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice of whether you want to open a new & kgraph viewer; or want to display the graphene to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all of the graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice and change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewal Load page gives the option of setting the behavior if a file has been modified on the hard drive, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or leave the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraph viewer; specify if a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraph viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked at each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears with one click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up more possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among various & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the & graphviz website are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerighted graphs. it produces representations according to the spring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a spring model for ungerized graphene. it uses the Fruitman-Reingold-Heuristics, and contains a multi-latch for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm ranks the nodes circular according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of several cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; the graphite file, or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or ungerichtet) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for uncorrected graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Displays the What is the mouse pointer. click on a & GUI; element to get further help to this element (if any).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available at this address and in the file ChangeLog in the base folder of the source repository.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tools to display. it needs the following packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special device is not necessary to use & kgraph viewer; in the Settings menu you will find more options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas: the main toolbar, the toolbars for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">Create a new icon. if the current file has been modified, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. after that, a dialog appears where you can choose whether to create the symbol from a template, or whether you want to restart from scratch.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module includes images to read new images and save them.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you scan the menu item, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. here, select the source from which you want to pick the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears to replace the default values ducrhe own to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After scanning the button, you need to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the image file options appears. here you can specify compression and type of image file. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore produces very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screenshots can be generated after you have selected the Import &gt; Screen Photo... menu. a window appears in which you can set different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select The entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program window is selected, the calling program will disappear to allow you to view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workplace. if you have selected the entire desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay will determine how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other workspaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialogue options of the target image will appear with the options already described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send photos to the people who are an important one. you can show your favorite photos of the world, display the photos of your camera online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Exportiere to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be led through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication. it is thus virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed to Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which shows the current permissions for the module. to upload, you need write permissions. the module currently does not support any other permissions. you'll be asked if you want to proceed with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add images should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. clicking on the Ok button starts uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The key field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">The Public, Friends and Famillie options allow you to set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken out of the value registered with Maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The Maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">KIPI Galerie-Export is a tool for exporting your collection of images to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export currently has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI geographically localization module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF key words of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographically localization module provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsGB can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. to perform a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same places as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data will be recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera will be converted to GMT. this can be done with the timezone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper variance for the GPS time and camera-time. if the variance is then the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no track data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Interpolishing and difference options in minutes can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and reset with the displayed map. select the region in question and increase sie.Make this through time and again until you have reached a sufficient level of accuracy. the map can be switched between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exitool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the Rider selection allows you to select all albums you want to export to HTML. you just need to select those albums. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Rider Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on an image, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth, you can change the default color depth. this naturally also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Tabs for the thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can read the programs to determine if errors occurred while generating. the web browser will automatically end up to view the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a windowed mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the below actions, without the usual losses on quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list for the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then, select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at hexidv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG video with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for slideshow. with this module it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates a very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave them black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings according to your wishes, you can start with the button encoding the generation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go for a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that codes or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is for example: make sense to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printout.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import / convert your images saved in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera developer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and launch the module. the Raw-Image Converter Window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG is using a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is saved in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image that is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 denim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 denim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not Proportional: not proportional resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent in advance.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be shown with the pictures you have selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image a preview is shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and drop them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Delete button, the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are already attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many images at once. most email accounts have limitations on the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG pictures in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages, in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diashau, a window with questions about how to display your slideshow will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL rendering option in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions thanks to OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, because otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually start off with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. thus, the order of the images is not used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds are about 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower left edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module currently has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting an image as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have your images and videos with annotations, you can work with & kphotoalbum; through these browses, see picture. as you can see by comparing it with the image, there are now entries in each group, so in people, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click with the mouse on the entry persons, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">This selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view with preview images to view the pictures of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you defined by yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have a suitable picture for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the Picture Ansifier window (in detail) and select the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you view the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties. this dialog can be viewed in the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label or description field, the captions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched; the date can either be part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but prefer to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick jump, the screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or select the photoalbum; demo mode in the Help menu. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this list you can see here:. as the name implies, this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database, displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select a range, you will be shown in the preview pane only pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the File menu File.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the revision and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on photoalbum; HTML-example pages, see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file to be created which is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that are obvious to the viewer without the description. for example, that all pictures are taken from a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images. this requires those who look at your website and own a monitor, which supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages were created should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them there. that the import function, see, correct, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The setting options described above have all three to base folders or URLs. a subfolder is created in these, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of all images in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file as independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the respective images are not found, the images of the URL you have when creating the HTML files will be scanned. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manual to copy to the .kim file, you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & copy the photoalbum automatically to the .kim file. the pictures will automatically copy for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal ZIP files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is the maximum size limit. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... select, will & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of people of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window which categories of the file to be imported, and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can match the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your boyfriend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) Setting information about your images, about (2) browsing and viewing, through to (3) advanced subjects and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been extended and today your videos will be taken care of. many places in this manual are talking about images, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal Backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your pictures are saved and use them in future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & photoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. for example: photoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; the different settings will be explained in the following section of the user manual.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In this section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a mediator as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digicam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & photoalbum; they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page which you can access via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with one another, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore you should always test new modules with the demo database before using the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't tell, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that share the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the downside when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications arrange their images in albums: this kind of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order for albums, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulate & photoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to transfer a list of albums. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. if you use, for example, the category people, & kphotoalbum; so do so if you would have selected people to view and share this with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the module you want to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you get & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top. below the toolbar you will see the window that you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain a lot of information as you do not yet have any information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate any picture with annotations. this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture, where the picture was taken etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">This is a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are mapped, you can, so that the names used are moved up, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetical sorted list, click on the Sorting icon on the list below.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the US. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a subgroup. to show you that this is a group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the note panel's context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or sub-category. additionally, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub-category of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the template that forms the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options... button, which offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to get this window again later, use the Options button... and then fade out the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the item pictures in your browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or of all images if you don't have a filter. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; namely, to use pictures without having saved them on your hard drive. of course you have to have the pictures stored somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all the pictures you need can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images from which the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive. however, for images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back again. so if you don't want to get annoyance on how to avoid the mess of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the File menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end the ones you want to make available to others and click on current view lock in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also select all images that your little sister may see, control and select the menu item All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have specified which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you are giving the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item lock pictures, so that all images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered in order to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, everyone can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private pictures to those with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and describe hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & kphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer. these can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered in the picture, such as who is in the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is on the top of the picture you want to see, you can easily drag and drop them with the mouse. you can also configure which information to display and whether any information will be displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries for this page. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures by Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image down. you can jump to the first and last image using Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slideshow. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. you can zoom out to zoom in. the Plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the Power key, the zoom sets the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they fall in and out with the plus and minus symbol.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the picture and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to provide pictures with characteristics while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter. in the picture you can see a picture in which the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have attributes to your pictures, these are available to you in the browser. so, if you have all the images you want to edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add all the images at once.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you view categories in the preview window, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will allow & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture you can see a picture on which was painted. to turn on the painting mode from & kphotoalbum; select On the picture paint from the context menu. to end the painting just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler, you need to know the application of the program & Povray; not complete, but the documentation for & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can remove selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu or from the right-click context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message with a fault description will be displayed. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User Documentation in Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the shown object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can see a preview in the Properties View.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the Properties View and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility Level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the stage of visibility chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as presetting. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical opinions on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need another configuration, you can set it in any way. you can also save multiple window arrangements and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below an existing view, drag the tap to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">In order to create a new column, drag the link to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the passer in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map-card-trader at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the tap to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the attachment strip.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the attachment strip. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views in the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with view window arrangement... save it. a dialog will appear where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray was up to date. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the View menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, it makes sense, but a name that can recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image excerpt for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the drop down selector quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lights. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the adjacent pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because each pixel is continuously split up and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually tracked and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams are changed by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflexion computes. it takes very long to get a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray is terminated unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the Import menu item... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet full range of commands from & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray. this adds to the source text of the object in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source text for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; render a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the shown object. here, place the path to your retention and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example, height field data) in paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in camera view and in the window-type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approximation for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">This page allows you to modify existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the window instructions section, it explains how to create and store window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: shows all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window arrangements displays all available window arrangements. a new arrangement allows you to add the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement. you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view does not anchored in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in darkness and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything flawlessly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following predefined window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the camera's target point. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you push the button Apply or Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you might want to insert a Quader (insert End User Quader) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome way to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite layer as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply or Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, even if at the moment only as a finite finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you will find that you can open the item for the floor, if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the object properties view.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise one unit below the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please choose first object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the properties pane (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matte black material because you need to enter the settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and the ball in the preview, click the Apply button and then click on the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the Object tree, you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently, but the board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose each time monochrome and change the colors in the object properties view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should simply do this step, as you should have already understood the basic method of working of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the object properties view, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would hover over the ground, because you moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the next step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the ground, the sphere gives a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose first object and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on Ball Pigment, then choose color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal: not selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities are available to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a rendering method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the Renderer is shooting hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that render the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the rendering calculates how this ray is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. any changes since the last saved will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu item can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeats the last reversible command. this menu item can only be selected if you have used edit undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcuts. you can change the default short commands for & kpovmodeler with this option; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting up the toolbar. you can add and remove tooling symbols for & kpovmodeler using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be shown either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBs, or the Return key.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set up any existing multimedia keys so that they work as & Amarok; -Quick instructions. this makes your keyboard to the & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general features that mostly can be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists browsers and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function pause might be & zb; so look:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialogue so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' dialog --sorry '# {error}' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow external programs and commands to be executed. this usually uses the exec () function. this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure specifies the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signal that a new piece is played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions you can ask for more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu item is clicked. in order to add an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle) to remove an entry.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; cancel, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. clearing operations. this includes e.g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packets which the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar) which can optionally also be packed with bzip2 (.bz2) .bz2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the exhaustion of amarocepscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can attach it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; append. for your entry on kde apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. you may also search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>

<seg id="1204">Usually, in the base folder of the Amarok sources, you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & Amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you shouldn't have any difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that can be activated or deactivated at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>

<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser of & Amarok should be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save Playlist at exit, save the current playlist automatically when ending & Amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist at exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you enable this setting, & Amarok; use relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, otherwise the absolute position of the music files will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date track when changing the play causes the playlist window to roll up / unroll to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Switching to context-browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can adjust & Amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the Fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; set by marking selections, the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window, and context browser. click Select... so you can select a font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice Custom color scheme, you have the choice of your choice and can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selector activated, for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback when resuming that & Amarok; after program start playback continues automatically with the piece at the place with which it stopped during the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Set up the subwindow on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is checked, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the desired font for the OSD from the dialog. the check box shadows causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if you do not use custom colors, the preset & kde; colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The input field Display Text displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders, the OSD can be adjusted to your needs. below is a list of available space holders and what they mean.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work difficulties, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by checking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers at buit.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash. then you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at buhl.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is somewhat mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Ensure that all libraries used by & Amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if such as & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if this is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl die "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2tag = $mp3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\" unless $mp3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you sink the GStreamer driver with the alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a blender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you to search for the problem of the problem and a solution. for gamers, you may need to specify another Sink (for instance, sink).</seg>

<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use, yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you already used previous versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow will have dropped off. the information presented there has now been divided into other parts of & Amarok; furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first part in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz Symbol. click on this icon to recreate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover pictures in context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current one. the file formats are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are treated preferentially. the context browser will also display cover images embedded in either the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can choose which information to display in the music subwindow. click with the right mouse button somewhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the artist, lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text subwindow, the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the song text. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search for google.com for the running track (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only group the top layer, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further distribution is made according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with various artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sorts to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order, the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your songs are first sorted by genre and among them according to artist.</seg>

<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping as you like.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-capture your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces it could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar you find a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. in the section about the use of this filter you will find in the section about the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a drop-down box with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can also choose from different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Pick up a selection - Changes a new album marked as a compilation back to a normal album. afterwards, the album will no longer be shown under different interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes the handling of many playlists very easy. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlists contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>

<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms by whitespace, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the keyword with quotation marks: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: review: &gt; 50. This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something searches for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example, Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this search for all the pieces that either include Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click the entries in the desired order. entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task is more important to which the enclosed programs give you the preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you are using dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following to the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP functions, which have all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMediaCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void fig.vd () void fig.vd () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project via # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString Administration) void addUrl (KURL:: list urls, QString Administration) void renameItem (QString path, QString transmission) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">With this, it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addurl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde; with it you can easily read audio CD; s and save it in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders who encoding (lossless compression) by default (These encoder packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders may be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and saved into WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), ogg (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoder / file format should be used? the chapter Welter Kodierer gives a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid purchasing copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called so often up to a suitable configuration), afterwards the daily handling of reading a & CD is explained. this (hopefully) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface, which you often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; retrieve information from freedb from the Internet or can work completely without network, all manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example you will find more information on how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the establishment of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be made.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it must be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already used file is selected to code instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog for the type of notification settings (such as logs, pipples) for program events (such as read out & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. in addition to FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important, as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high pitch quality (at high bitrates) but slightly lower quality compared to OGG with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG plays is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for lame (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information obtained manually or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title must be added by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer instead. it is to be noted that here is only spoken by text: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Note the translator) am not lawyer. however, nobody can prevent you from going from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt. all information can be obtained anyway during a stroll through a & CD; shop, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving data from the server (this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator is set up to use freedb, the nearest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection tool is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save into WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see. note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the proper distribution first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; konsole).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program make exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; read out. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It is necessary to have cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine, since it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permissions on it (eg; trying to copy something with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what each outgoing & CD must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with which freedb to use the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them when reading a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program, so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom can be a symbolic link to the actual device name of your disk. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab will help and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map menu General settings. here's not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is loaded / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only in the case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed if data for generating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet during the read-out of the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; this is associated with minimal risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb is not used. however, this is above 620 MB big, consider this twice whether this is worth it. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. mode is set up on the following card board.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, but as many firewalls bok the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the 80 protocol, because the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take over the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously exhibiting pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and encoding? the author does not know, therefore just try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; throw out after reading the last piece: check this to check the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be leveled to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent id3 'Tagger for & kde; in case of subsequent change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoding WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be attempted to encoding more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just have the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as a default for each reading of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music cleverly, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk is running. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was written in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is built, since we want to fetch data from freedb. the process that is described in this section has to be repeated for each extension & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not included in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data recorded for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of retrieving them from the internet. comments are pointing to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; can be identified as an audio CD; can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then look in the FAQ section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD was successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; gives, a window will pop up, and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; Settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of inidividual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the freedb the CD-Editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD; in this example it is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you will come back to the main window. just click on the row with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the BOM.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off. make sure that all pieces are selected or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button Select button to start reading the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Riders tab to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we've typed here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this will be read out and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. the machine used with a AMD64 does not seem to be a problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of course two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read out, while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will pop up with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window into the & kmid; -window. this works also with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Delete button in the toolbar, select the item from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (in several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid plays a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the slider.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two functions: if a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the Pause Pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the piece, so interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, start & kmid; play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use song lyrics and others both. some pieces don't even have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically ascertained, the one song is used, so you don't have to manually set the karaoke message. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select from the Settings menu the entries Textereights or Liedereights. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. in this section you will see how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will at the beginning contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the counterfeit in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song by adding a song. it will again appear the file dialog with whose help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when a piece is opened. this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the pop-up sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be reset.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke message.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the next song button, add the item next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the previous piece button, previous item from the menu item or press the arrow button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not stored when you leave & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map converts General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of type Change patch to Bright Piano into Events of the Change patch to Trumpet, and thus always lets a trumpet sound when a piano was originally supposed to play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need MIDI-map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required realizations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. the prerequisite for this is, however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap..." END Define keymap "Another keymap..." END OPTIONS... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; Support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equals string is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument requires to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a rifle shoot (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a rifle shoot. to do this, enter the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shooting), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term drum patch included in the patch, where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the rows is very important, as is their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you just have to use different names on the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are mainly used to depict sounds on the percussions channel. see for example the provided key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the 16 or 9 channels).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which attempt to change the patch on this channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion channel on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, should play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards will try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you will find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard, you see what sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played notes. view the view in the Settings menu under the Channel View menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The Tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (e.g. from kmid; 's start)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't feel like adding all the files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag and drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, make sure to set automatic addition to the collection. otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard speed you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror on a & kde; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, only change to the & konqueror; -window and drag the desired file to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly, without adding it to a collection, turn off the Setting Automatically Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.A. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open your temporary collection then exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this animates me to further to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrose.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I don't have much spare time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anyone. I therefore want to emphasize that I only do more programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or even a supporting email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the web, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid can be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you cannot of course hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mail lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s, TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished yet & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save preferred links under the Bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Definitive Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical level. if you select an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the clicked record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select the playlist from the playlist and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the Edit Mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start-up does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would bother with the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; bodylog; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer;. here, the path can be set from the MPlayer and the clipboard size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'console' button in the toolbar of SMB. here you can see the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & SMB; it can even include the special video URL to YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend issue is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always take a given backend for a certain mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvPlayers). before TV can be looked at, the used device and the TV channels need to be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in SMB, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port is to be used. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR only supports XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SMB uses different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these are dvdnavy, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVsource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hints on how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be run as user root after attachment of the device. it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom will show on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts up slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhaust. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will test the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be picked up. the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first choice box is for the quick insertion of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box For further information is available for articles such as tags, footnotes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command will create a term for a section, a picture or a different item.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a defined term (selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">Using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing of & bibtex; files are necessary editors necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files may also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop down selector with the name GrÃ ¶ hape e is used for the definition of the font e. you can specify the font names for the main text, the footnotes, etc. the following letters are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also occur later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex has to be compiled. the simplest way to do this is the use of the menu building or the push of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; performs the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document is compiling, it should be searched for errors in logging. when using Quick-build, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font e 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} then allows the publication of the font e within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only supervised within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat printing, italics, subcutters etc. can be added. these commands either end with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italic pressure and is long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a proposition can be displayed italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; markup language is presented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments to the better readability of the document should be performed. for this, a quotation, a few passages in the fat and italics pressure, and a poem will be applied to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor-View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a PDF file; just try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device independent file format (D e V ice I nfond). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the legibility of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printer, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file, the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking a DVI, the document can then be printed out using file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into other formats can begin by means of buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-search function allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; binary files. only Modern can be set up under Settings Kile... Building Blocks can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for pre-selection, the mouse pointer has to be positioned in a row of the source code and then clicked on pre-search. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Use this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (setting up eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should there be no error when using the Quick-build DVI; viewer, there may be an error. if there is an error, this will be briefly displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file tells the source code in the source code. in the editor, the flaws of the LaTeX-Errors and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX error can be used for jumps between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to view the defective line, the error in the log file must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Loyal users of & latex, usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in & Kile, to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex or file must be opened or a new file created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created in a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for posters; can be made directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Posters; and to learn its possibilities, the manual on Kate should be used. users of & Kile; can place there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of posters; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called through the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in & latex, and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way, when you click on the\\ par of\\ par\\ biga, only\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the & latex works differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizard groups can add additional jump marks. this is a special kind of bookmarks within the text. menue Edit jumping marks or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. thereby, this jump mark is highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & Kile;. although & Posters; already offers outstanding possibilities, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code has always been added. & latex; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a whole paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). with a paragraph, there is not a text containing clear lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. this is the only acceptable thing in & box; is that the sections are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word below the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning, as this command also applies & latex; commands with a back partition (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex. that's why & Kile offers; for more orders under Editing Environment for a more convenient work with & latex.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a number of nested ambient orders, you can quickly lose sight of the remote view. this command completes the last opened environment, so that the nested environment is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that match those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is on or behind the curly bracket of a & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When input of many nested grouping braces can quickly be lost. this command completes the last open group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a guide. for the purpose implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two simple instructions. also for the ending of the application the sign" is used. "</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insert of double quotes can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g. augerman or French) and therefore German or French quotation marks. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; enter key for & Kile; enter an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break but at the same time the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Enter the current line with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already offering a good source code completion, this has been added in & Kile; three different modes are installed. three of them work as needed and the other two are fully automatic. all these modes can be set up for different working modes under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment using the\\ begin {environment} will begin & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and this is the result of the execution list. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command. alternatively from & Kile; also jumps are added, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of hock marks NÃ ¤chst jump brand and the changed parameters can then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; can complete settings to these lists. there may be different list lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as wipers of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. there always have to be entered a few letters with\\ begin and the call of the complete mode will have a large e list with environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for performing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the complete environment or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. thereafter, the ambient remediation can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; detects that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... dump; Complete can be made to these lists. this mode uses the complete list of the completed mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>

<seg id="1921">If the newly opened index.docbook is opened, simply select the current working folder. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">When it comes to an output on the screen, your file is faulty. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be validated is already marked in & quantaplus, then the current file is simply checked. if not, delete the checkbox at the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the well-formed file is well-formed, click the Well-formed Check option.</seg>
<seg id="1925">For using a & DTD; which is specified in the & XML; file, select & DTD; (External), otherwise & DTD; (External) and enter the location of the & DTD; using Defining-URI; schema as well as for the RelaxNG check is the specification of the definition URI; in the file selection is required.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; also has a & XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Should the file to be processed in & quantaplus; already selected, then let the current file simply be selected. if not, remove the selection up-to-date file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Specify the name of the file to be named as the result. the file is normally stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, which & quantaplus, invite, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and don't have to wait until someone uses the fake in & quantaplus. the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a KPart, we start editing with the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog enables you to manage all the included plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location, & quantaplus, this path to locate the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship with each other on a project. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of one's identity are important with regard to messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see in for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project. one example would be to record the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that inserts a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Event Conconfiguration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, Events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. addressing can be a team or sub-project leader. see how such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter notes is simple. it may either select the Note entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a designated member of the team. in this case, the syntax is @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the team member's nickname.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around brackets and tags declare the comment invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, the DTD-agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only over & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting Quanta. this dialog runs through some pages that are treated one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal bulk / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, for tags, for which the closing day is optional, this will be inserted immediately upon & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish tag automatically: when switched on, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the default button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). this setting here, however, will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting here will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be recovered from this backup in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be previewed either in the Editor area or in its own view (or documentation in a map section), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the windows settings back to the default value when the user interface has been messed up by changing MDI modes and docking / deprecating views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message section is used to control the possibility of switching the display of warnings by check of no more.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change behavior of & VPL; to change. it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source-text view in shared mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the representation of the Parser node in the document can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action executed by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Change settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree will be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting abbreviations (a kind of templates) that will unfold when editing to larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the ifW abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins can be managed. plug-ins are KPart-applications from third party, which can be reused by any kpart-enabled application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it's not located in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is given to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "component in" "" "read-only" "" "mode: check if the plugin refuses to load the load. only read-read parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then try & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. unselect allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely new. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a Debugger plugin concept has been implemented, which allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently there is only one plugin available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -UI:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all the holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to the debugger if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to Debugants. this action is triggered by default, when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so you don't have to pay attention to it normally.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session Starts the session. includes the connection to the debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to deduce a debug requirement. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to constantly send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without informing information about the variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if the script is given, the execution begins when a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include items.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the instruction and proceed to the next as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale and this part of the documentation. & kxsl; ist ein & kde; Front-end and a KPart of xsldbg, which can be found on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adjust & quantaplus; to your needs and how you can help & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for brand and scripting languages and & CSS; they enable & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, file descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbar buttons are handy, symbol-oriented toolbars of image buttons (above the editor window) that insert text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how tagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the Properties dialog, which & quantaplus; for the tag shows. the descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool tracks allow for quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag Folders carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to each other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Provides the source texts used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used for reaching the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagging%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag which groups the elements of a list together. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. for each one; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be available for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces don't affect anything, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files is the Tools dialog at the top of the & quantaplus; -window to start and check TagXML. to choose. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, verification only occurs when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; scheme. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tagXML file. this file describes a & PHP; overload function. the filename of this TagXML file will be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload type type =" function "returnType =" optional "/ &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Editor DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = reference 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be created with Settings... Create. click New Action to make the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. clicking on the user-defined button can be used to assign a shortcut; K1 can be used to remove the current keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First you must specify the name of the script and the interpreter. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, & quantaplus attempts to find the script at the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the current document URL. in the case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus, by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods described above, a script input of & quantaplus can be used. in the selection field, input can be specified, which is to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the exported application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, directed to the standard output; error messages, on the default output. it can be specified, what is to be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the drop down box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings Action.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete all and, if the day has attributes and you are planning to use its use, enable" "" "Edit Tag" "" "dialog if available, so that an input is possible when using the action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Show other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; default 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will mostly be interpreted as loose, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be indicated that clicking this symbol will be a & lt; started; tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, as there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the tool bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the tool bar to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar can believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by halving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure to the right folder. after NeweXHTML does not exist, it will be implanted in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the proper folder. please adjust their file descriptionrc, so that their toolbar (s) is loaded (will) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. first part we leave you, the second we treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in main index top element = description for these documentation for example & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Section1 = func1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Remember that the table directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that serves to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is indicated. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or else to whom. at different points, there is an email-sending menu item, like the DTD DTD package (DTEP) sent by email, the toolbars toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a child's entry we recommend to sign the resources, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. enter the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and start uploading by clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload toolbars toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature. in case of problems it warns and it can be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by & quantaplus. however, the creation can be time-consuming, because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that appears in the Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / ip http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; can be adjusted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and to take full advantage of & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction is concerned with a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus. all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbar buttons, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emogallows the joint use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the flashcards with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the tab with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with entries matching the current document, such as closing the current, other or all the file, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run from CVS instructions to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor section lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar buttons is really easy. if you want to insert a simple tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click on the icon that represents the tag. if you want a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and to roam through. in the representation with flashcards are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows the management of the files in the project by right mouse click. actions like Add, Remove, Upload or Delete the files from the storage media can be carried out using the context menu shown then.</seg>
<seg id="2093">A further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, an entire website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears beneath the other tree views. with it, some attributes and namespaces can be changed. the content-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development to be found. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; from quantaplus. you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the way to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, specify. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffold is not only allowed to users and developers, & quantaplus; as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation can be found with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or help khelpdesk help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. see the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there are converted special characters to & HTML; -Note, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -Description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Enables or disables the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; script error messages out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Removal and switching of the problem reporter at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the location of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. that allows, for example, to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are stored in project Dir / Toolbars and are only in this menu when you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">This creates a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions need to be saved using Settings.... tool rails are saved through toolbar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or someone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; It makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be freshened without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder does not exist, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">This activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus. inserting it by means of tool bar refuses to comply with the rules this day.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above. click on them. click on a activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the type; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or create ungraphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode corresponding to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, details can be found.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete or add entries from the toolbar and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help corresponding to the mouse cursor's environment but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled the best from the top to the bottom, because, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except for processing local data. either a name (hostname.example .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g., PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, it does not tick.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your choice.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by hook or, by removing the tick, exclude from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow Profile or using the Shift; F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcards possible) that are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Uploading profiles can be set uploading profiles (see in), as well as displaying a tree view for each profile's content for each profile by attaching its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can enable event actions and add, modify or delete events. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as a file's backup. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar. open the Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files find. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, however, the opening and opening words are missing with... in the context menu called in the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button deletes to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">This option is useful when frequent uploading of files is needed and the rather unsecure password on the disk is not stored.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving feature or a risk. use them at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and tool tracks. there can be many views in a project, that is, by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted from the Project toolbox in the Project or Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus, to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus, preferably stackable via the toolbar. use and Addition are different. adding toolbars is discussed below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu (right-click on the tool bar), in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can remove, rename toolbars or set toolbar buttons, which can be specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files for connecting. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory to the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file besides text, i.e. pictures, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more special documents are nested in corresponding subfolders. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-based. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As a template save as local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template file under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File save as template save option as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged and put on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and drop or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files you can click on a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and backup. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very purposeful approach. you can pretend header lines and footers or dynamically linking with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the template subwindow is based on the files in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parental attributes are advertised.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows leading or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for a whole presentation already with the appropriate headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit, the source editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor, and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. with pressing F9, this mode is already active, the key press moves the active cursor from one window to the other, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... According to VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small gap for fast calculators and a large gap for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select document properties. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the dash encoding. this can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information on the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the merge and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way connection is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are shown visible. if lines are only differentiated in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more annoyance if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other one is different in one line then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folner2 kdiff3 Folder 2 kdiff3 Folder 2 -o Destination folder kdiff3 Ordner2 Folner2 Folder 3 kdiff3 Folner2 Folner2 Folner2 Folner2 Folder 3 -o Destination folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog will remember your selection and display it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, however for B and C a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field will be active for target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to set up an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup knob opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before starting the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare an entire file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, upload them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present you can't get anything from & kdiff3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the Info line. the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C assigned. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that is good in the next section (merging) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is represented on the broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an Info line with the wording output:, the filename and [modifying] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, any difference at the same time is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump to the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing; no row in the queue; displayed. this is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and maybe yet again select another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a selection that you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The Text & lt; Conflict Conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignoring the options or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, side, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auction window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert button, you can switch between insert and write mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary column synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the compilation and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / first / last difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up) to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Image Abwards) or to the next / last unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you must press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. however, be careful with this option because you may accidentally overwrite the clipboard contents.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + newline feed\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps track of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at exit and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered streamlined. on these systems, the presets button automatically sets an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tabulator button is pressed. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each option is automatically copied to the clipboard. manually copy the manual to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 attempts to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step is compared to each line. in this step, white characters are ignored. even when merging white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character\\ r 'and a newline'\ 'at the end of a line, others save only a newline'\ '. usually ignored & kdiff3; the carriage return signs may look identical, but like a white mark. during merging this option has to be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', 'n', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are nevertheless shown, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is downlighted in the default. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely searching for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in presetting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically Advanced mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unsolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge operation. look for details under documentation to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Customize the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to stop & kdiff3; quit and restart to activate the change. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set for each entry separately. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for encoding, a short notice appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you edited a file, you can specify which coding to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress duplication of changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply exit the less important windows. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Subordinate the comparison window to each other or to each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge operation and uses the file name of the last source file as the default file name for the output file. (if this feature is used to restart the merge operation, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first transferred to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that meets your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessing command. the output of the command is only used for line comparison. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this prefix for line comparison to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an arduous expression of the found text in the first bracket. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all of them follow the same $keyword generated text $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you might even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KS3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessor for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and any hit is replaced by nothing, thus virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e 's / RegExp / erExp / erset / eraser' However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) is needed, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. further operations will only change the data that the line comparison algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline pre-processor sees the output of the normal processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adapt the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and displays the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as base. if no destination folder is specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not merge. to start merging, you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window informs about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that were then compared are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scan of the folders is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded down. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the item or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories fold up and unlock all subdirectories with which you can open or unfold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed of problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Synchronizing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folders have been specified and if the option Synchronize directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file is selected instead of merging (unsure) is enabled, then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. As long as such errors are not removed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, a file is executed after the other. status column shows ready when merging has been successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unsolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all the matching actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, C will be used as the target in the Three Folder Merging mode, B will be chosen as the target and when synchronizing A and / or B will be used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options by which certain entries could be skipped. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to merge only the current item, select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that indicates the faulty item. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Browse, Simulations and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select again start / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3 will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to solve the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been combined individually, see & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at the later merging of all entries. even if the merge action has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>

<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a preceding point marks a file hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: when the option is turned off, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links display. this is downlighted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Links to folders: when the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and searched for recursively. (note that & kdiff3 does not check for possible recursions.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the date of change and the file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the Date Modifying Date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, if the modification date has been lost. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the later file is suggested as an action. (this is considered insecure, because it is assumed that the other file was not changed too.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another file, then the original version is renamed and obtains the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension exists, then it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merging of individual files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merging view remains visible to the merge of individual files; you can switch off the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want that, you can switch the Directory & Text window to the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly merge a file by double-clicking. however, you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder. to do this, use the current file merge from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency using KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (please refer to the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDef3, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, & kdiff3 assumes that the input file is a unified file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; then start & kdiff3; the patch program will start to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; performed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing files is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's compact) already exist. in addition, the name KS3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff3 program from the Diff-Tool-Collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or get it like that.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. configure the configure in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines, next to each other, this description is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes itself for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text suddenly appears; no src has been left, and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found at http: / / kdiffusforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir Specifies the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">There & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any problems with compiling. if difficulties persist, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift Delete) copies into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. inserting (Ctrl-V or Shift Pasting) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only display differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries that show differences are displayed. this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge operation. (the behavior is switched off in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the A, B and C label below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is downlighted. farewells in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini-preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both within a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, Windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager, clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager... and Beaming. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as entries minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the commands effect the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when a application has been clicked.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed along with the name, the names will be marked with numbers, eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop will be displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs are shown as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically, & Kpager; in a 2xN grid appear, as is known from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical line in a vertical line, which is very well suited for viewing on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniprogram in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move windows as icons or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up switch settings... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this can not be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. If you don't have a write permission for the file, you must log in as a user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you need a functioning installation of KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag, shows the enlarged section of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnifying window. the image shown in the magnification window is an enlarged pane of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting increases & Kmag; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magnifying glass. alternatively, you can show & Cold; to do this, make a selected screen area in the magnifying window (drop down mode) or the area of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to see the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; -pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnification window. this is also possible with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, press the & Shift; press key or push the & MMB; use the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, copy to a file, copy to the clipboard (to insert it into other applications later), rotate the image and more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to turn to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is required.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will appear. the selected area will be shown in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your default short commands to store files, open a new window, print, reload (with the button Document again load in & konqueror;), Enlarge and Cancel & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kpossibly also known as & kmagnifier; is a screen lupe. you can use & kmagnifier; you can use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo. this application is useful for different people: from researching or artist to web designer or visual disabled.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer persists in the same place. it is intended to help people who suffer from the repeating Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and can emulate pain for every mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also be caused by the mere moving of your mouse. if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain that occurs when clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitor your mouse movements and execute a mouseclick as soon as you stop the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent push-button is activated, make & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent pushing requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click will execute.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligently Move is switched on, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool, after dragging the mouse button, wait before it release the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse is done.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click by mouse shift. if this feature is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system there and here the Reiter General. there is a slider sound buffers that you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently only under & kde; available. with GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the last press release.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later add the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not display a link does not cause unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take the mouse out. as this happens, mouse is mouse to mouse. it should be clear, however, if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can be scratched easily with a flat blade or a fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool, when an imposition has just begun. if you use the intelligent push-button in this case, that means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute even a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. however, you can park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, a accidentally mouse click can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar buttons and menus and the titlerows of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent moving is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can deal with it. it is very well possible to mark the text, copy it to the clipboard and then insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Don't use the smart move if you just start & kmousetool; use it. select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key down while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this makes every time & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shutter speed starts when the intelligent move starts. later, you can use the smart move even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. that should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers, and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer persists. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI's syndrome and causing pain to be pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to allow a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dropping can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktops; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Words are edited in filters before being sent to the speech speech program. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the speech program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differentiates four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The display of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the display of the screen reader is pre-read, the sustained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning has the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed following the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you read & eg; a long text on a web page, you can start with & kmouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order that you infuse by the card pass is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktops; just one such read, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String translators replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with predefined string substitute filters that allow replacing chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformers use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have a female voice on the card-card speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is used for voice output. if the filter states that its rules do not apply, the text remains unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -Notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the set-up normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following entries will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up string statement filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the speaker is speaking one of the languages listed here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl-key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text is from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs can be obtained using the qdbus program; the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 indicates, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter if identical. if all input fields are empty, the filter will apply to all text.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will not find a manual for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Expressions can be found in the cesstils package.</seg>
<seg id="2649">& XML; -Transformer Transformer & XML; with the help of XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such formulations. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>

<seg id="2651">The speaker selection filter lets you send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card speaker, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts from kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text sent to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the voice characteristics that the program displays, the text on & ktts; sends, and the characteristics of the speakers created on the card board. you can override the chosen speaker with the speaker selection filter.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any voice synthesizer which can be started on the command line in a single & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. see also on the website of ktts; for information that is not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The "speech-Dispatcher" program uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktts; for the use of any other synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; -conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a new development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including kdelibs packets and development files for the "speech Dispatcher" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for kdevid or downloaded the tarball created each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you start & ktts, first check if speech speech with your speech synthesizer works correctly. you can use the shell script of the SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops used by the speech-dispatcher program. the kttmsgr utility should be developed so that the use of speech tools is directly possible and that the SPD-conf file is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is disassembled into individual sentences. the user can return sentence or paragraph style, repeat, stop or cancel the issue.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application passes text to & ktts, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is female and whose sex is female, this will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker is automatically selected. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; a speaker selects, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add to Addition on the card message board, and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the box ID device setup will be displayed. for example, the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. details of the modules can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival in PATH is included, you just have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the string encoding for text that is passed to the festival. if voices, the ktts are known, this setting will be done automatically. generally, Western languages will use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliding controls, you can adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthesized language. if you cannot select some of the controls and display this gray, the voice you choose doesn't allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multisyn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so (with larger memory consumption) the first set is synthesized quicker.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window ttsmgr will be shown at the start of ktapmgr. otherwise, after the start only the symbol ktapmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is checked and kttmgr is not running yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD is reading a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the read-up.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence. the ID ID corresponds to the ID column ID of the card speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series you can move forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes of the settings (also on the other flashcards) will be taken over and ktapmgr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts is not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click the audio card. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Only text orders are listed and managed. screen readers, warnings and messages are not displayed. for more information on the message types of ktts, see.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Select the type of audio output here. if a component cannot be selected, it has been started & ktts; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or ktops; the necessary libraries can not load.</seg>
<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aKode is to be used for audio output, select the audio output. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the speaking speed here. 50 nbsp;% corresponds to about half and 200cc, about twice the normal speaking speed. in order for these settings to be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to Apply the new settings for the running & ktts;</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system. most of them will not work. you need to find out which device works with you. in doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card card you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of speech applications:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The display of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. once the screen reader is read, the queued orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you read & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can talk to & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, add & ktts; the audio output in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory note is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card pass are valid only for normal text orders. for news, warnings and the spending of screen readers there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To start with & ktts; read KNotify news, run ktapmgr and click Alerts. the card message notifications appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to enable the read-out of & kde; -Notifications. if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are disabled and ktts; don't read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications for which a sound is played, by & ktts, will not be read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message that & Conversation; mailed when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this selection field to specify what's to do when an event arrives. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the text you want. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the characteristics of the speaker that you want. default chooses the speaker listed in the list on the card speaker as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All notices for application Default (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this purpose, you can set the notification settings as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for notifications in a file. use the Load button to load saved settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except all Notifications are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) as it is the default voice, the festival is used in the edition of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation filters (SDB filters). SBDs divide text into single sentences. this allows & ktts to start faster with the read-read, since only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the byte recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set of byte recognition filters is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add any other byte recognition filter, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The simplest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out. switch off the speakers selection and enter text to read. switch on the choice of speakers, change some properties and check how the choice of speaker is changed. to do this, you have to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then faster with the read-read can start, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the voice synthesizer does not support this function, you can execute text orders on the card card.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up if you start ktapmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Byte recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabulation signs are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard byte recognition filter keeps the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never used on & kde; messages (kittens), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the standard byte recognition filter from hiding, you can insert it by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card selection list, you can overwrite the speaker settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top on the card speaker). in other words, no speaker features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker that has all the characteristics of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktops; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the speaker you want. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only thing you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a certain application sends text in a different language than the specified in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the properties in the area of speaker that corresponds best to the following, click the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 for the last word order is in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Ktapmgr immediately crashes when it's started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get back tracing.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer has crashed and ktops; it has been terminated. GStreamer 0.8.x will probably have to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by this, a non-compatible version of GStreamer may be installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA doesn't work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">In your system, the problem is that conflicts with ALSA are occurring that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, see the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it at festival, but ktrimgr will not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Please add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / ktv / ttsd / festivall / bind. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card audio card there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive offer even on the card card for speaker setting a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting from & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite bold, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to-SSML transformers filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that Festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects SSML according to Saber the GENDER tags. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string statement filter and now I can go in & ktops; no longer be pre- or backward. on the map handler jobs is displayed, the order exists only from one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead, use a filter for a set of punctuation marks instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>

<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music at the same time and let a text read. furthermore, if you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you have a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read even more.</seg>

<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkad.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetwork--the device at all and allows the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers will be charged for network hardware and other devices when installing & Linux; with installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected in & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be identified, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and the Releasestand. by checking the setting non-re-questions the setting can be set permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The full functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button interface... set up in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual can be made without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field netmask the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface during boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as needed. switching off an off network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on the need. switching off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the computer in the local subnet that conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub-networks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If more than one network interface is present on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator named part of the name resolution module allows a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be re-ranked by selecting an entry and execution or downgrading in the list with buttons executing or herding in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... You will see the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named above describes the hostname-to-IP address reference for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used during boot when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list of names known by name contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the review of IP should replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the familiar hostname and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button. if the well-known host has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Knowing hosts will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2830">You can perform one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes must be set in a & Console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetwork--is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetwork.conf. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, in the second section all of & knetwork--alterable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4) are currently being used. IPv5 has never found widespread distribution. IPv6 expects that it will continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact person who uses a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.070; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the host). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork--and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is accidentally re-sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which in addition offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective pack.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included in & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; returns the band and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects & kdat; don't recognize the prep on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the default pin searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the Status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by opening the tape for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to see that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape type must be formatted before you can use it to save data. if your tape drive requires that a tape needs to be formatted before use, this must be done before you can format the tape before use. floppy drives generally do not require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity & kdat, continue with the tape formatting. all data on the tape is lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be saved, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save Menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been introduced, the dialog opens up Settings for Backup. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the Save dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog will display settings for check. in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the check.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the check, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can redirect the restore, the files that are to be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog will display settings for recovery. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will restart. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index in two ways from the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be saved will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up that are on the same file system as the folder. folders located on other filesystems can be listed separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Executing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files has not yet been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variation of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; lock the ejection at the tape drive. it may not work for all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, it is automatically discarded when unlocking the & kdat file. do not use this option for floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. regardless of whether this setting is active or not, you must tell & kdat; in any case, tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are tar archives, which can be administrated directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; ist ein & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystematic log; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the log files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog provides experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions that can filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, syslog server format and Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog provides functions for easy filtering and sorting of each log file of a log file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystematic log; first try to open the main protocol file of the system - the system log. if this is not shown, and it opens instead of a small message window, you have & ksystematic log; most probably do not have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log directory, for normal users.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or string. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so that only log rows are displayed that fit to the selected filter. in the default setting, the drop-down menu will only display all of them. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only to the entries in the correspondingly selected column. for example, select the process column in the log file system log, and enter the name of a process in the filterbar, so you & ksystemlog; all log lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. level Error log lines are displayed with a more eye-catching color than Protocol lines of level hint. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched on setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new log lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystematic log; allows displaying multiple log files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the pop-up menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org where you can find more information about the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystematic log; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystematic log; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and so named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init quickly becomes the standard for monitoring program starts when the system starts up in & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">This is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and formatting. the Linux kernel first looks at / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc rather than directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to boot when running the system or when you switch to another runway. system services include such things as Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial that is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">If you need it, rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the beginning a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you'll come to fix it by rebooting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? very simple: every script is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people would like a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runway running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runway, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand tool is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runway to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. thereby, the entry is removed from its original runway (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new runway, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore records thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the various workspaces (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection over- or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runway, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runway with insert (with Ctrl + V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press Enter to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be recovered from & ksysv; stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard running leveln, and now the machine is restarting continuously. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runway to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution at Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that exist only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distributions but is unfortunately not a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are needed by the respective system service (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just end without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runway so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to start reading.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you make changes, you need to save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save button in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled wildcard (quota) for users, a card pass is created where you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card file password management will appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if at least one embedded file system constraint (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable from the file quota.user / quota group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space restrictions are given in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected using the field file system with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups menu provides information about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click the right add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO bootmanager, add, remove, and modify the boot password, change the time to boot of the standard operating system, add, remove, modify operating systems, remove, modify and more.</seg>
