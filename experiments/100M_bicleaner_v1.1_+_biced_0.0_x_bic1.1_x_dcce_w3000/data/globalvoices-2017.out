although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time now .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is enormous .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced American music , read American authors and practiced his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
when I was 14 years old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was only reinforced .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about its size .
then came Donald Tru@@ mp .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is to me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops in his opinion behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ic@@ ans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and agreed to him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t recon@@ cile Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply religious man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
it still fits to Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos; involvement , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life .
then there were Andrew Din@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp took his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , reported the pres@@ idency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates a inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of them know , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( BT@@ WC ) : as much as &quot; White against all other ethnic groups , &quot; word game from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones described , has killed exactly that which America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America on this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ n K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son was fallen sent him a message .
that &apos;s Tru@@ mp@@ s Land now , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

out of the misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t let their love for music be destroyed by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r user O@@ AS @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with its musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students became the central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and the gang violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ mo@@ il you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga to play .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of Paraguay &apos;s largest garbage dump in Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez have started turning parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all produced from the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a man made of apost@@ asy .
today there is a whole orchestra , which plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the musical output : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces approximately one billion tons of waste every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra has even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before picking up the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles have quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to discharge one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing licence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was unable to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , owing to the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( illegal fishing ) .
the members of this network are the six countries next to Somalia and Madagascar , who then expelled the prime ministers from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like and work together . they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o that circul@@ ated information between individual countries , action happened today in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noted or experienced during port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify vessels that fish in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious routes can also be discovered - such as those that suggest that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal offen@@ se .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultancy firm committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover , which lost eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year because of illegal f@@ ishers who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
such practices include sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license documents , fantasy seeds , fishing species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international collaboration and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t attack my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front has been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is supposed to help to find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
yet F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that provides satellite data and the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is evidence that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously f@@ ished without licence and had little consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now reported a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tractors on board , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries have joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also comb@@ ating illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . . &quot; safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used drag fishing nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also steep@@ ed in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela escal@@ ates further : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; re@@ covering the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
this picture of MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the march in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void , when they met on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country , including in the Bar@@ inas region , in the An@@ de@@ an regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ eastern federal government of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute shortage of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the government decision in its latest article :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine is concerned , the referendum on the country has been considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or a short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , called on the demonstr@@ ators to take part in a mass rally to support the National Assembly . in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the follow day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , were planned to continue on November 3 .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
it is so far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday national civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .

particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved to the local Cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government , according to their own testimony .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safe again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already makes the round revol@@ ving around the amount of repression a day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for a ten@@ ement authorisation procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others regard these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to refrain from critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches increase more and more to frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an town of CÃ³rdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of family life .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is being manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my dad started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . I was there with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him K@@ ent .
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have contacted one of the ERP .
don &apos;t forget that they are not going to dec@@ eive you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be al@@ right . for so my father had educated me .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
on the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack where cars , furniture , TVs , fri@@ dges - just everything was possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
over there the prisoners are tortured .
I went in and saw a couch where people were tortured .
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who was just tied there .
they in@@ frequently tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and pursued a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... as a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell right away and I realized that the od@@ our of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied up .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people were sitting quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero beat a man there and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information provided by survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death to the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ hand@@ i , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kidn@@ apped people came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils of war &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; means of war &quot; was - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that are taken away from an enemy that one has fought .

but if one goes to a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who are driving cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me , and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I testified in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a rolled @-@ collar pul@@ lover from wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
now , where I am older , I receive re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship , but why the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
one could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom they could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me that when democracy was re@@ introduced , they picked up machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something always remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie myself .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - my father .
the idea of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to witness for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he just said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then I &apos;ll show you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I published the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am bi@@ ased . I have finally spoken out against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a fall of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 year old child .

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended because of crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 The convic@@ ted were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court sentenced him to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ ze : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1995 , Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country where La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now directed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend their driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a particularly mis@@ led translation .
on a shield , the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ k@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; was wrong@@ ly translated - perhaps even with evil rear @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible car drivers . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from the 1st to the 20th of September on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake occurred to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was first removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before they were published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News deals extensively with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the above @-@ mentioned repor@@ ter gave comments to the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ el against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among others , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation not at all , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language to translate the translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers learning Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations into their own company . then the Japanese staff , whose English skills are considered the best , are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace human translators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be unacceptable or at least harmless , but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translation in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ ajo con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online channels have also taken over recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and deleg@@ ated the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended use of VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : enable your VPN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ s@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly delegates its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests for specific domains .
when a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds fla@@ wed or refuses to request the request for such an Internet site .
we establish a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera team El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it is also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multimedia coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ p@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who were exactly like victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a tural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , falling Schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly said about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she , out of which has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another more mature family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for several years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ ans - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
they tried to call things by their names , because the feeling of gratitude that is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ adi@@ ans generally does not guarantee silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is , on the one hand , the family that has her daughter in the belief that she will complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of her &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that embra@@ ces the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it for many years .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , was given a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n entered hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official in the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra reached Mar@@ Ã­n with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the girl &apos;s death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lam@@ ented .
without documents it is much easier to un@@ punished un@@ punished children &apos;s rights .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ mean .
if the case occurs before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be trend @-@ setting - if a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go occurs in the history of Paraguay for the first time in the history of Paraguay .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ ans are exploited not only as man@@ power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to sign up and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the time and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked every day between four and six hours .
she had to share the time so that she was still time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was finished she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the household &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand beside him and read articles from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the official media reports on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone to listen while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of the Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would once again speak to Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ in their native language .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose , she explains .
she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
in the school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is mo@@ b@@ bing and har@@ ass@@ ment where Cri@@ adi@@ ans are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ te .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt especially clear that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share vac@@ ancies for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s Administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a small mate for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
beginning from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the summary of the ad split once more :
dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the shop was completed .
im Pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ ans@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ans , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors conquered land in Paraguay ) and the system of the Men@@ Ãº ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to pay tribute to them ) and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted on a draft law on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulation in terms of use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would be set up that is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and identity card numbers to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine of money .
the draft law , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and is used over the Internet to communicate with others through voice , video directing , and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced if it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how the Egyptian authorities should be able to impose registration on the users . it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to maintain regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ arians and promot@@ ers of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Technology &quot; ) at the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislature and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament in whose sense control is maxim@@ ized and must be assured that no aber@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was intended for those guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; trying to protest . &quot;

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this article is published here as part of an agreement on Content Sharing .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal trainer H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ards .
altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera trap , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a likes to show passion@@ ately a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs in Nature for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wild animals are established in the Kurdistan Region .
Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , produced this video for En@@ sia .
his works have been published in numerous international publications including TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times .
Meyer made films for National Ge@@ ographic , P@@ BS , CN@@ N and HB@@ O .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the north @-@ east of Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom crash in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to attack , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal cities away from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture had an accident , already alone , 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from the local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the paper includes statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the persons concerned themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , 77 per cent of the planned replacement homes were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the closing light with 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by accommodation establishments ( the K@@ haz@@ et@@ su Su@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , one still stri@@ ves to reloc@@ ate to final replacement homes .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelter shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the people who were evacu@@ ated in 2011 from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of Ev@@ acu@@ ated , who lived after the disaster in hospital shel@@ ters , were moved into final homes .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , accounting for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures schools .
six years later , the industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear black@@ out zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the Ev@@ acu@@ ees . she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done .
as for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in her issue commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper intensified its attention to the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witn@@ essing the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160@@ ,000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement homes .
after the 2017 state of 2017 still 40,000 inhabitants live in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ees still live in shelter shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be staged in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one encounters a person from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global compounds . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the com@@ mon@@ alities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ manu@@ man explains how a walk over@@ came her affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa writes about the lack of shared language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial com@@ a after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday a police officer took him to the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ana . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a traum@@ atic brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus circul@@ ating quickly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures it is also possible to recognize the face of the police officer who attacked with a single stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers how he strikes at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs soon rush to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family living in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was split multiple times in social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ el@@ ado invites further acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he had sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stick .
police gri@@ ps for the police
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which there was brutal police raid against prot@@ esters last Friday .
police officers put in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from talking about violence against prot@@ esters .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped the street protests by steering the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen .
the following ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo have specifically reported a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
you must also recognise this if you are strictly against any form of property damage .
here too the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the Dis@@ abled Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the congregation of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ onn@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that have been in operation after a long period of in@@ active time because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and barely competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that sugar could produce for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural Com@@ missions &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with safety , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
over the next few years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats the most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents agree : not one of them has been informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be maintained , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of the reign , the first letters began to come .
these were officially auth@@ ored documents , which differ@@ ed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ f Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters were more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ used factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ top producer was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services that the plants were generating in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is only extracted high through grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the folk congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory concluded , or rather , when they began to remove them , they also stopped to gr@@ asp@@ ing the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other enterprises .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became part of spare parts .
without the prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma plant , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine edi@@ ts bring an ann@@ u@@ ity of two thousand pes@@ os per month to the old soldier to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a stra@@ it@@ eful person , yet he does not forgive the lies you told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
at the age of 65 N@@ ene is in retirement , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ass Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them . they do it through Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop managers bring mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by ped@@ ago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop will rise to the fact that the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ al@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen young women often disappeared or were murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences through globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the fac@@ ebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the stan@@ za is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can grow and go forward with our youth as well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how they can do what they intended the Creator

in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( the other way out ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , will be displayed next to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; Plas@@ tische Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; ) of each dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce the plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is transforming them into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger named it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new types decorated with plastic courts , as shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tokyo Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food orders is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part we have prepared for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple holding your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach into the comic .
some mobile stand and cell phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ rib@@ bons from dried salmon .
for more qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic dishes , see : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # , the other hand on Twitter .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry , for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts actually are made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trafficking , &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed completely the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each bone find behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with Dru@@ gs Tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ que que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( german : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father looking for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and look for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me too .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are frigh@@ tened . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership .
the project is based on stories of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a lady from Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to it or consider it as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) if he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ capacity of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village could be justified with it that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers too .
we will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are away from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested for you do not know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in those terrible days , I wondered if crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ent Generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every age .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to average 8.5 murder per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .

&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this post and the pages to which he links contain pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising up a rum@@ or or f@@ lar@@ ing out a fake .
but how is the year after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been widely used to conduct trage@@ dies occurring in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thereby devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , one of the tan@@ ker lor@@ ries fell victim to death .
officials &quot; representatives described a fire@@ ball which envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a cinema close by , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and char@@ red corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the im@@ meas@@ ur@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carb@@ oni@@ zed bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically from atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated visually .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again , when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comment@@ aries such as this example wrong@@ ly relate the picture of the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments .
the painting from S@@ ange appeared also in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning strike , published by the United Nations described those who could flee , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following are those who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture stems from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news site , which fal@@ sely claimed President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Being , monks and politicians had taken part in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the image from DR Congo to make this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed at the end of April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source were also wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein alle@@ gations , but had not related the picture of the DR Congo .
the worldwide operating range of false data
traces of this false coupling date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search using the search engine Tin@@ eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mass of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some others have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of impro@@ per use and associated them with the respective countries based on which side they had been published . thus , we want to show the reach more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also inter@@ connected ) several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from .
here are some cases that can now be completely r@@ ins@@ ed ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries point to pages or servers which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ eye , probably also show counter@@ f@@ eit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City names not only the false report , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the picture from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian section of the place .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o was divided into public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the picture from the DR Congo , on the one hand , a tweet , the sympathy for the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted , as the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government issued a notification of what they came to see as &quot; deliber@@ ate news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech conducting and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and mig@@ rate ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the picture of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted Th@@ ein 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , Catholic near @-@ standing news site An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the El Pa@@ is newspaper attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo showed , along with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay more attention to those events that were presum@@ ed to be in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was taken as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the message contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture eventually may carry a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ estimated in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers no longer have faith in these images .
with social media , there are many people who in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study examining how violent media are acting on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss in the news media with regard to violent portra@@ y@@ als , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be replaced by the context or entirely impro@@ per nature .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take account of how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog ex@@ poses the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog containing the name of un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or impossible to translate at all .
these words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are necessary in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example , words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Do you care about your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wine here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 coun@@ ties in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the Sri L@@ ank@@ an disaster centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and close to hundreds of people are missing for the flight and slu@@ dge av@@ alan@@ ches .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been placed at 30@@ 4 safe places of stay .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ bil@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood control .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods sti@@ f@@ le the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already underway .
this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the water level of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a which occurred yesterday .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and another five will be completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also agreed to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provides important information on flood control and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call + 49 7@@ 77@@ 4@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks anxious people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up support and raise funds . they were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge .
they also led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slide .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring people in need of security and render assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , and the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

utilization permitted . in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I have trusted her four years old daughter , she has trusted in me her children : she is my rock in the br@@ anding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next we en@@ code rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , others en@@ code slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they have mus@@ ci@@ zed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like I do not fit into it , are being kidn@@ apped .
m@@ yo@@ genic Dis@@ mus@@ cul@@ ature
I don &apos;t stand alone with it .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ? peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad , until the day when he died , was the center of his poetry .
but in the Western vision , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the ab@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been trying to col@@ oni@@ ze Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground @-@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American schol@@ ar Edward S@@ aid cuts the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I &apos;ve seen these powerful , fla@@ wed narr@@ atives that dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even vote for its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and forced Saudi Arabian , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ cally weak@@ ens Muslim women who carry out movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans that were brought hi@@ ther with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and in@@ correctly that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population is African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants originating from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan re @-@ imagined the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unavoid@@ able Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American woman ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I &apos;d say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some pocket orph@@ an , all Muslims carrying - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa wo@@ e . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t wear all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be a the@@ ological expert to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ trained Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with enco@@ ders , think tanks , and experts for false information that have manipul@@ ated our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that swe@@ eps a woman &apos;s head@@ scar@@ f .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter if I kept her silent in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verse to the protection that seal the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask you to be protected from evil , evil that you can see and evil that you cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim sense is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the picture of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; as she decades ago , winning a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation which - over centuries - has been col@@ oni@@ zed by an empire , founded by a company named Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .

belonging is to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan res@@ ett@@ led around his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he had not allowed to enter his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all except four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ mis@@ sive of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were aircraft , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops station@@ ed across every continent apart from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to hunt weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy asks the US and the suspect has a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave with the name Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ filled the airports in order to fight against the Muslim .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life counts .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our multiple ties , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1,7 billion hides more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reducing branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this branch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries it bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we have to throw away from Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University gave participants a scientifically correct image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the bad and dangerous forms we get in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

but I am concerned about this difficult global moment in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me a Muslim today .
things I have left here as a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone else &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ mi@@ cians talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I talk about this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be fought and people by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , were themselves scientists at Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the employment that we have no president , while he has already bombar@@ ded countries and &quot; other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
history telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , learning stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS does not lie on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been running events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often associated to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , feel , touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , history narr@@ ators first introduce and translate their story in their own language and then explain it in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their depic@@ tion lead to the fact that the audience sett@@ les on it .
they evoke feelings of laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the Daf@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ en@@ ara tells the f@@ able from the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his cable , John Ny@@ am@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers are hoping to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling stories .
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re @-@ establish public debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the Republi@@ can Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was declared by the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Ci@@ vic Front for the No@@ vor@@ ing of Deb@@ t ) and the Com@@ edy Church Convention of Puerto Rico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishing debts have also submitted a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed remuneration of our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the state alliance - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will be liable without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night guard for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian website developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is organised in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called Book S@@ prints , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Refle@@ ction ) .
the book published last year and available roy@@ alty @-@ free includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introductory part of his book titled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom immediately .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up from time to time extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison , a non @-@ military institution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Military Police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had taken on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on November 12 , 2015 , it was contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , his place of residence and state remains unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ tion &apos;s cultural prototypes were more anticip@@ atory than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles f@@ use with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life trying to dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already detained .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a sample letter she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was detained .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens on every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison &apos;s crow@@ ding
and I will enter into every detail of your voice and words
with passion with my passion ,
I don &apos;t know what to do
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...

the history of the Bas@@ el is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convic@@ ted of corruption , head of prison quarters again on previous post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed .
this is the The@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants for the em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ ets ( around 800 000 euros ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose council was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company , which happened on April 19th .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not proceed with disciplinary proceedings after his arrest .
however , many inhabitants do not call this action good .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we note is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company , however , seems to have no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had subsi@@ ded .
he could give paid speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn &apos;t say anything about morality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone would be rewarded in such a way that has already massi@@ vely offen@@ ded the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serves the state . * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead has only served itself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is imprisoned :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president to the Mozambique Channel , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of selling also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , spent 10 years and was free .
and today the company , in which he uses mon@@ ies , puts him back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ conspi@@ r . ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took off their posts from the network , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ors the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( column ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ bs A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner , whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the proposition ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is convinced that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before comb@@ ating all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write at Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the opposite words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all those who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply going to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author commented on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales , that would be great .
Facebook cens@@ orship has provided lots of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have emerged who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally address the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where thousands of Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have looked better on context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .

the pedi@@ gree is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the child &apos;s age is now 18 .
before this change of the marriage , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public scre@@ am . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sever@@ aja , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that is , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; each person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys among 19 were married from 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were striving to abol@@ ish laws on child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated cause , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law declare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update to Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once it has been approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws of child marriage had finally been changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minister of ministry in the ministry of education , said :
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk disgu@@ ised with the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth every price .
while Abel was the opinion that it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot; news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
foli@@ age Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that talked right to the importance of the adoption of the law , noted :
the age of age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the draft for the change of the marriage was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
all MEPs who were opposed have voted in favour of the law .
the pedi@@ gree is legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Gender tags .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
thanks to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the gu@@ ise of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the general secretary of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most known Hind@@ u organization in the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj ple@@ dged his intention to take court steps , the law was to be passed and he seems to have to undo his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al @-@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was perfectly legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wanted to address the issue differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear Sat , if we hold the discussion so generally , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem , that the state , which protects our daughters from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are over against them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the child &apos;s toe is legal or still the norm in various shades , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia site was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally obs@@ cured .

for over a month now Turkey is blocking the popular and popular cyclo@@ pedia based on crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking .
although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using ren@@ aming tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been publishing articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as has recently been described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , periodi@@ cal block@@ ages of the internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was passed .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and often updated .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is also accessible despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after having heard the news ( via blocking of Wikipedia ) , we are doing everything to put sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer using his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colours .
this motivated him to take a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nepal to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) suddenly called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was on and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he was standing before face to tig@@ ers face to face face to face ,
a tiger can be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep not when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when the king of the book suddenly appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
take a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to express their hus@@ bands &quot; names for the first time

this post was auth@@ ored by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ Law@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ released as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , and fear of consequences should dis@@ regard the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a mock trial and rejected by her family and community after she had addressed a married family with name .
the tradition of their wives also not to mention their wives is also common among men . however , they have far less pen@@ alties to fear , if at all what , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ sh in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and quickly became the main conversation topic of the city .
it is a place for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese has been working with her video camera to expose practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the ban@@ ishment of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this club .
she reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands on their behalf .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women could easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom that they have kept all du@@ tiful and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name , wanted to try at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to get the discussion going on with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese from the village Wal@@ sh in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ ak of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women may never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she only smoked in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another chose to release the entire accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands at their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ fully resulted in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ap@@ ed red dot on the forehead that shows the Eh@@ Stor@@ atus :
why do women just have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ ap@@ ber@@ red dot if he would do it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think that they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip for each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to tell you certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ em @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they didn &apos;t get married .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the mor@@ ale associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled its own pair of kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could carry them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will make it .
Roh@@ ini att@@ ests to the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club has changed :
so far we have only done small steps .
some women tasted it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and there are no other members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at all times .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - are at the end of a hard @-@ to @-@ navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japanese visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les when landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was the &quot; Great Be@@ e Day &quot; ( The Beat@@ les Memorial Day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , re@@ marked in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Com@@ mem@@ or@@ ative Day in Japan . at the age of 51 , they were here in Tokyo .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll is to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course some companies also use the fan base from the market , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat r@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to run .
so , we hope that you are here !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that the bald @-@ headed men in Mozambique could be the target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of persons for organ trafficking , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the Mala@@ wi@@ an border .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men have been registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country has conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Mos@@ ambique police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place .
hus@@ ked Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police had already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably dev@@ out rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans .
in the last few days three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the Chr@@ onik der Blog@@ gers arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ ED GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME is ashamed of a country in which people would be ashamed to have sex against good marks , and to make sex against good marks , a country where people would not hurt sincere pursu@@ its or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald people would be hun@@ ted , which aim to attain rapid wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of them missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Z@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ faced :
Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the murdered people .

we are deeply concerned to experience the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and express our sincere con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively engaged in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ g@@ gers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ el &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people who were themselves acting as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death but gave no further information .
bas@@ al stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we honor Bass@@ el &apos;s oeu@@ vre as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years .
more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared since 2011 and the start of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or disappeared forci@@ bly are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced late June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion , &quot; having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet , China continues to obtain calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him to treat him abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad .
Norway and the Netherlands
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon trap to China , as the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union and the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as she announced in an announcement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they are to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to freely communicate with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would like him to have the possibility of treatment abroad so he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message asks the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy asked a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley stated that China should offer the following to the couple :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can engage in proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany in the past
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert said on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously reported diplomatic sources in the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and the Caribbean
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called China to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to be worried about his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and to contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um further talks :
Canada also ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom of expression .
France and Germany
France &apos;s foreign ministry asked China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he is . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information on whether France would eventually receive it .
Taiwan free of charge
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan asked China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the dise@@ ased intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 around Li@@ u and indicated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog bl@@ amed the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian performance in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one hears that we are ultimately no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the Singapore political system with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of this , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently w@@ aged by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the issue , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leave the distorted logic as they are better suited to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests about our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system , really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he disgu@@ ised these questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of rational fashion .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points to the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the full tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who makes such pol@@ em@@ ical statement as leader of a growing generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed by what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes that is right and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country does the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet &apos;s cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our prime minister have to pay back ?
what is the value of our pink human identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear testim@@ onies like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defence of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home country or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I asked most about in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly when they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little that sets us apart from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if I would be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ uri@@ ous - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian double @-@ lon@@ er ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
that can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justi@@ n Tru@@ deau walked the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada really sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band that is famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dy the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the band Tattoo Link describes a young man telling about what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend makes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicit politically , the music video is indirectly related to the persistent military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta .
take a look at these videos , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the Supreme Commander of the Army an absolute decision on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosec@@ ute those who accused the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ingly against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Supp@@ lement ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it turned into a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before entering an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in jail , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; Die Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ k@@ arch@@ al .
it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ k@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ mal@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Central Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the majority of Russians and rab@@ bits are living in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ o@@ sts .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ k@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 since it has barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey housing blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called Chr@@ u@@ sche@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ ying and rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all serving the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and van@@ ishes .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ en@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she instead supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was just broken away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration capital in Ab@@ k@@ hum@@ i ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once held , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation draws to an end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now follows the ball .
while they are running , some of them throw stones onto the deca@@ ying buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , caring for their lives .
they do not know it any differently .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name M@@ om Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the way through .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2,@@ 50 per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; mo@@ m Africa !
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , buying them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ sam the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil earlier and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
it declares that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is maybe very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to black@@ mail money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to follow the next steps .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is back full of guests .
in the courses , travellers always consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
she fli@@ ps like a proud grandmother in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair ties she made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she introduces herself to me .
&quot; yes fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;

the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of U@@ rum@@ qi have received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web purification &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the police announcement , the app was able to identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ g &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web sites , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network .
this app is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; remote &quot; remote &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to monitor the digital activities in this region .
while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , constra@@ ined ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; the cens@@ ored news published in China , displayed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen subsequently checked the residents whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the abuse technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the City Council of Ministers to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office to operate their computers and communications equipment .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued an order on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police until August 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is &apos;s personality rights of three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the sleep or death row in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and find that you are alone in a place where all the important things have van@@ ished .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both from the inside and from the outside .
one who makes all honour to their name .
one who has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality catches you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters are transformed into flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is spinning on the axis of disaster . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but this is not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security guard formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were pulled out of the beautiful garden of our revolution as a peaceful protest .
it was sufficient for the city to sm@@ ash the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
all the districts sought out , only my own .
for the first time it was still , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we joined us to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations fully and fully .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you write Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar or you are only brave enough to shout when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes settled on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really gri@@ eving what to look at my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was standing in front of the building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father straight away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the yard and into the second office that leads through a walk to the single cells .
I am impressed by all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have allocated a larger cell for me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner and may set me right away without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an established method of communication : to beat the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells seemed to be a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness there are no marked facial features for me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
maybe he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
the li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to ch@@ ase all these crow@@ s that linger on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that the horror was presented to us in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be li@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security from us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail map and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house here , that is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I enter the inter@@ ro@@ gation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I am used to not responding .
I really can &apos;t tell you exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to make this penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear myself as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , probably from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er is rejo@@ icing in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator had worked as a collector in the past or whether this belonged to normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them changed while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and did not take any pleasure in doing so , which is why he was next to an electrically charged bar .
power f@@ lowed through my entire body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half @-@ naked body , which lay stretched on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two horrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed that happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and get away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes cigar@@ ettes in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he shu@@ ff@@ les to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which belongs to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b family to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and question their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ torial music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are relevant not only in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities that extend from Damascus in Syria up to the whole of Yemen in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluct@@ ance against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as a second generation Palestinian - he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he dissolved into water Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the gap of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , drinking water - in order not to land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan canc@@ eled an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ai contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to &quot; advocate &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be just rhet@@ or@@ ical rhet@@ oric , but can indeed reflect an increasingly clear , cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b revi@@ ved traditional sex men by educ@@ ating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a seemingly comfor@@ ting unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hon@@ our mur@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan does not have institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 crime control law , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can be kept in prison for an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release many years of bureaucratic effort and a guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to shy away from topics that are long as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , a man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
politics was in@@ timi@@ dated , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated conspic@@ u@@ ously :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that can get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans in Jordan and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to mem@@ ori@@ ze later that his comment@@ aries were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly recru@@ iting the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ de , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service noted several former governmental delegates and members of the teacher association , stating that they have critically commented on the problems linked to the corruption deep down in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not through bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to carry on and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Neb@@ at Festival .
it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the solid trol@@ leys , the drums and the dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the West mar@@ ched into the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region , the em@@ iss@@ i , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ tall car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

outer appearances and personal care rarely have been as important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rau@@ b and illegal drug trafficking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the out@@ lan@@ dish hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can reproduce these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition , which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts confront each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy school , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , have an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice to get an education in the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of her achievements :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community .

the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
this is exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign &quot; Cart@@ a p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n &quot; ( letters to reconciliation ) encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently their land was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC ( German : Revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the point of view of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and , around the clock , had their weapons with them , now have to integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now enter its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , who are to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation began at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need much more .
he plans to share his love with people that needed the most urgent response this year .
&quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC emerged as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience like this :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ el@@ books &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go there , because beside him there was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices for new voices
at the outset , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC met for a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have witnessed how social injustice on the part of the state was affecting the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people , including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were made to believe that peace would prevail after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we at the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , like a ladies &quot; sword , has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published showing the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who took suspi@@ cious que@@ ens men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt she was really a woman .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned of the sex equality of their country@@ men , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
in the last analysis , she moved to the USA for fear of her life .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the lap .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was about to bring out some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to honour the family , you spot stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital .
apparently , some women had heard everything and began to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which patient &apos;s wings have you been placed - in the men &apos;s or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they put absurd demands : some told me I needed to prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ sn@@ y and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad address , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I still can &apos;t understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought them without registering me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you would be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know what kind of hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that is a tab@@ oo subject .
I still wear some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish I can &apos;t overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually make an effort to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have lain dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had sat in ar@@ gun for a month and a half .
he told that no people were arrested and tortured during the Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not finish a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
this is what I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : aren &apos;t even gay men arrested in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
if , then , especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to execute Kad@@ y@@ rows Jud@@ gment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , but were specifically immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we assume that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called non @-@ traditional orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
I think , before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ sn@@ y when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer then than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria never insul@@ ted me just one hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people as I met .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about another &apos;s mis@@ fortune . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased nor struck .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stood on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality in television .
he did not speak about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could sense how people started to change in the city .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I returned home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you have to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ ded refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ away ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
this is the nature which has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys in them .
the D@@ age@@ stan@@ ers have which , the cab@@ ards have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I become so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a strong rise in suicide since the last few months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew back the desperate situation of the Arabic Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that could arise for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video posted on YouTube kept the moments when he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arabic Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have appe@@ aled this month .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family F@@ athers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab ancest@@ ry suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arabic Ah@@ ra@@ zi community resi@@ des in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most productive and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of that wealth .
it is often a victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has refused to systematically refuse the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s to diver@@ t the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to exac@@ erb@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k youth now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are seeking employment , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and have a university degree of 45 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the mind of national Resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
as officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their native country .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name in order to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be employed in such a way as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab at@@ tire .
given the circumstances that the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists Alarm alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , nor with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . shot by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women - call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all Fem@@ inists .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all of this is known and known to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black wom@@ ens , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial separation and discrimination , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raise their voices and sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in order to reach equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migrant background are more often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to take injusti@@ ces in her thinking , which relate both to gender and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized Being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings that also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender , because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to instruc@@ t them for a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was established to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than to use myself for a white @-@ feminist paradigm which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ or@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book African @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by defining us in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and where the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call Separ@@ atism and Exclu@@ sion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that in@@ particular reports international efforts to solve environmental problems .
this article will be published again in the context of a content sharing agreement .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special request through the Iraqi Kurdistan Region . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who works and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of their work lies on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed congregations that can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from the c@@ ity@@ . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ter Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) that reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed her mal@@ treatment , the ac@@ ten@@ tious ad of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez used nothing .
a few days later , the second woman moved back her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women complain at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must contact the law enforcement authorities at all .
content 1 pun@@ ches and statistics 2 Un@@ seen mal@@ treatment and a legal system that does not prohi@@ bit any of Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , mal@@ functioning be@@ atings and statistics
it is hard to see how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studio , a social science research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available figures , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the district prosec@@ utor &apos;s office attracted 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence . 70 % of it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace courts . also here , 86 % of the ads were reported by women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s mini@@ stries Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to each woman who is reimbur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal offen@@ se , law enforcement agencies cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , a woman died in Paraguay every ten days due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she asked . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she carried out mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would ever be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that the only women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing a name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long enjoyed Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) composed of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements for the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was deb@@ ated in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which became known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # 2 ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ on@@ less ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal law and to punish tough@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the law text was modified in a number of ways in order to win the dep@@ uties for the law that feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be lev@@ elled , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and are punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill intended to pay the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they simply want to report and provide secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ ation is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be a re@@ think so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who are silent in the face of these facts will complic@@ ate and contribute to the perpetr@@ ators of the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to refund so long until abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes will be dealt with .
the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance section has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim once more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dele@@ tion of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Foreign Affairs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in jail where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had buried his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , alongside his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , chief commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , public freedoms , including freedom of press , limiting and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since it was founded in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 . this led to corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having pres@@ sured judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by ISS to the special department and arrested at his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information concluded that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper in any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison terms and fin@@ es of 3000 American ri@@ al each ( $ 7@@ 800 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a danger to public order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a security deposit of 5,000 US dollars ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was set for Al @-@ Abr@@ i and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ha@@ j in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the om@@ inous government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the minister once again opposed the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ visit the publication of the paper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in Oman in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ inous authorities are still not prepared to put an end to the extensive breach of the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j to release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the paper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring states by promoting freedom of opinion and association , and the right to gather , support , and offer protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his permission
medical research in Africa is rarely or even not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , a large number of medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare sector , covering special medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for the Study of Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed its first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sam@@ bian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the main focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
Q : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay a receiver instead of being a mo@@ ver himself .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
Q : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development chances are better in other countries .
Q : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
Q : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
Q : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
r@@ w : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system that magazines use articles only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the US to India : how open @-@ source seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been cultiv@@ ating salad since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been set by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many varieties of salad it can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents go not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cur@@ ly leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on is still cultiv@@ ating salad , but it now takes longer since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if there is a b@@ oul@@ der in a river to mate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we have to do now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; he makes as good as possible and tries to breed those traits that he wants .
however , it is very careful , however , and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station have bred and ate red Roman salad of the Out@@ ra@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit themselves to the use of other seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds , to breed it , to breed their own varieties and not to hi@@ e it immediately - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Board Member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seed and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to seeds , seed play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds , &quot; says he , and takes care of the increasingly frequent mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot; whoever wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the growing number of intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is thus always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of Os@@ si , has been working in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about a third of all car@@ rot traits are protected as intellectual property , thereby making it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or at all .
there are no estimates for other plants yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that large @-@ scale cultivated plants such as wheat are still patented in an even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders does away with more and more patents . at present , genetic diversity is more needed than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperating with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection therefore does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to be able to grow on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to be : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a whole , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of using plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in O@@ reg@@ on and Os@@ si &apos;s member of the board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds one species , also breeds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the majority of smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the experim@@ entation or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders , Frank Mort@@ on , looks for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes that farmers would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am stronger than companies with my efforts to produce new products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which you think it is quite easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in the open source breeding , the concept now spreads quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is launching an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the Os@@ si obligation does not simply apply to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the Organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open @-@ source seed systems , which should be officially launched next year .
an association of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report on food aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a varied local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon recognise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has been particularly important where and how something is cultivated and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5th August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities strongly critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its aim to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these objectives , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era due to the alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

apart from AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he directed to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the target of an attack .
B@@ logger , the provider of which also is home to Canada &apos;s blog , is accessible on the other hand .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting about the student protests and recording a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced the government &apos;s block@@ age and reflected what this means for him :
those who lock blogs is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ im@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) They managed to convey me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , a sum@@ mons from the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web page I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after having closed it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
it also documented the blocking of providers caused by the circum@@ vention of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army is in use in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in Rio de Janeiro , during the governmental crisis .

day after day newspapers report in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves ro@@ b the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and air@@ ways to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation the 2017 violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene .
reports such as these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio , published on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision like this :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize war .
in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , when distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ ina Oli@@ v@@ eira contradic@@ ts the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult to hold accoun@@ table to the police .
this is not a war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of the public service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the murder rate per state , Rio is on number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for years , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , has said that , as Cec@@ ina has stressed , the state &apos;s security policy has been repeated for many years .
among these security policy measures was the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several reports , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports about har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho , in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to remain alive : learn to plant besieg@@ ed Syrians to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ dge
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to the victories Watch , a common initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently about a million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding countries , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , those areas controlled by rebel forces have been under siege outside Damascus , leading to the need for local residents or through tunnels and control points to be smu@@ g@@ gled .
due to the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food @-@ based foods in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its foods make them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed east Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Di@@ re@@ kt of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P , the French news agency :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years we have been fighting to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is becoming more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining promin@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do can be used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the cultivation of mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds coming from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that they planted a small mushroom grav@@ ey@@ ard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger bath . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break@@ age of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by using food residues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new food .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many major cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government calling for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also recorded in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 explo@@ sions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Cruz , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ bes - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users shared pictures :
that &apos;s Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ bes # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
many videos spread across the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why the civil defence was unable to reduce the extent of the tragedy as much as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o sovereign@@ ally of the Association of farmers of Portugal declared P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far @-@ reaching &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wal@@ let reform &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposed by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val takes on in the same article of P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread according to the fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zation of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents looked for information or tried to contact relatives offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in 2015 to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were unable to resist the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website was more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in one night in autumn 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time together with his family in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan .
even if his mother did not say that at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
at dawn the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

C@@ CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt protective .
the Taliban known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af sold his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe .
during the dangerous voyage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
for some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to people in need twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high demand rates Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers have in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3,000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum , which can go for months after registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it happened to A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ bo@@ unded lon@@ el@@ iness helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af made his entire savings to the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( English : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans have developed companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afghan Enter@@ pris@@ er Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp in Pad@@ ua . there are also Afgh@@ ans behind the Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
however , A@@ shar@@ ehol@@ es &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy sector and retailers and aim back to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , opportunities are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans to make plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and performance techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : draft laws from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the Camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ oli@@ ath Report is an international snapshot that displays challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media , such as Twitter or Facebook , only after a registration by a government authority .
users must register in order to be able to use social networks , register within six months after the submission of the legislation on the website of the authority stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step may be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the termination of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which has been promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committees of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce tough@@ er sanctions for the insul@@ t of the president or a high official .
under the law proposition , such action would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the im@@ pe@@ achment of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in prison for more than 700 protest participants arrested at the same incident .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May because the prison line , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused away from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , the pseudo @-@ burden of , among other things , possession of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza declared the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ mad al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sanctions imposed by journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist inter@@ ro@@ gated to scann@@ ed documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been largely inter@@ ro@@ gated to a guaranteed plan of action . according to the plan , the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill that would ensure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali accused of corruption , provided they return all illeg@@ ally received funds .
the document released on April 21 , on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential plans for support of the legislation look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on 9th May .
will China force users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new regulations by the Information Bureau of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also specified in the rules that the registration with full real name will be required .
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks . it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app we@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ comp@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the dis@@ semination of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and forcing them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , mail@@ .@@ ru mail service and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as block in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication had been blocked because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working with groups to create a political de@@ fam@@ atory campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website , which is , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop knot@@ ting her@@ pes
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install tools that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civil population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until the 19th of May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
