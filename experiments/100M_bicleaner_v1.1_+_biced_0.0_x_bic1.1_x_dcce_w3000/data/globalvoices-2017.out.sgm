<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time now.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced American music, read American authors and practiced his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I was 14 years old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous plot of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA was only reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is to me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his opinion behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamericans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and agreed to him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply religious man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to Kristi Kappes' involvement, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexities of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Diney, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump took his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, reported the presidency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of them know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (BTWC): as much as "White against all other ethnic groups," word game from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones described, has killed exactly that which America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America on this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayn Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that's not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's Trumps Land now, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguaan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with its musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students became the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and the gang violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the turmoil you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of Paraguay's largest garbage dump in Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chavez have started turning parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a man made of apostasy.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra, which plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "records the musical output:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played its music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before picking up the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorors, Mozambique and the Seychelles have quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to discharge one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing licence.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishery authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was unable to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, owing to the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries next to Somalia and Madagascar, who then expelled the prime ministers from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like and work together. they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo that circulated information between individual countries, action happened today in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licences, news on suspicious activities or details that were noted or experienced during port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify vessels that fish in forbidden areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those that suggest that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultancy firm committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover, which lost eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishers who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such practices include sailing under false flag, counterfeit license documents, fantasy seeds, fishing species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically use the lack of international collaboration and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-complete organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You can't attack my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front has been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i is supposed to help to find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team of African nations can indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that provides satellite data and the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "the Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without licence and had little consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now reported a 33% increase in fishery turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found tractors on board, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also combating illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i.. "safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used drag fishing nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also steeped in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the march in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the Venezuelan government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the impeachment, the Venezuelans responded, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void, when they met on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country, including in the Barinas region, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-eastern federal government of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation in the country is deteriorating continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venetians by an acute shortage of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicolás Maduro; in the end, however, the holding of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision in its latest article:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine is concerned, the referendum on the country has been considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or a short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces, called on the demonstrators to take part in a mass rally to support the National Assembly. in addition, a 12-hour strike on the follow day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, were planned to continue on November 3.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday national civil strike and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter paintings are piling up pictures of quarrels, as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators moved to the local Cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government, according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could leave the cathedral safe again, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise you could see something that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round revolving around the amount of repression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for a tenement authorisation procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean town of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of family life.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is being manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not realise that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my dad started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. I was there with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him Kent.</seg>

<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be alright. for so my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack where cars, furniture, TVs, fridges - just everything was possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Over there the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I went in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>

<seg id="346">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend their driving licence, in the last month witnesses of a particularly misled translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a shield, the Japanese word (koreiksha), which means "older motorists," was wrongly translated - perhaps even with evil rear-thoughts & # 8212; as "terrible car drivers."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from the 1st to the 20th of September on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake occurred to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun, published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The erroneous English translation was first removed. the name "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture excused for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before they were published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are really sorry that elderly people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation)," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News deals extensively with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a matter of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 accidents of seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, the seniors created 1,803 of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus its share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen during the same period.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language to translate the translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers learning Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations into their own company. then the Japanese staff, whose English skills are considered the best, are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technique can't replace human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be unacceptable or at least harmless, but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translation in the future.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels have also taken over recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by oppositional groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and delegated the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended use of VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: enable your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">"" "" "" "it seems that websites of Venezuelan providers are once again locked." ""</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsfiltro confirmed later that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly delegates its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests for specific domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a Web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds flawed or refuses to request the request for such an Internet site.</seg>
<seg id="407">We establish a DNS block: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera team Elvis Flores, who survived the protests in Caracas live, was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it is also reported that the government regulates the Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans more and more difficult to access multimedia coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly said about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she, out of which has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another more mature family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for several years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke to Criadians - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">They tried to call things by their names, because the feeling of gratitude that is injected to the Criadians generally does not guarantee silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is, on the one hand, the family that has her daughter in the belief that she will complete her education, improve her position in society and "make something out of her" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that embraces the girl and justifies its exploitation by faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it for many years.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín entered hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official in the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira reached Marín with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the Paraguayan society responsible for the Criadazgo's death for the girl's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they called the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga lamented.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to unpunished unpunished children's rights.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Crimean.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criadians are exploited not only as manpower, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to sign up and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the time and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked every day between four and six hours.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she was still time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="526">Altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs in Nature for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the north-east of Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom crash in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a state prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbouring counties Fukushima and Iwate were forced to attack, because the tsunami had vanished entire coastal cities away from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima Prefecture had an accident, already alone, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From the local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the persons concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, 77 per cent of the planned replacement homes were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fukushima forms the closing light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by accommodation establishments (the Khazetsu Suutaku), one still strives to relocate to final replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelter shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the people who were evacuated in 2011 from Fukushima were still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of Evacuated, who lived after the disaster in hospital shelters, were moved into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, accounting for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures schools.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima are located in the" "" "nuclear blackout zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the Evacuees. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how her empathy has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper intensified its attention to the situation of the Evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima Prefecture was also witnessing the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 people from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 state of 2017 still 40,000 inhabitants live in Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuees still live in shelter shelters are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be staged in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When one encounters a person from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>

<seg id="593">Left: the attack against Mateus Ferreira da Silva. photo: Luiz da Luz. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widely used photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week. last Friday a police officer took him to the head during a demonstration in Goiana. nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a traumatic brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus circulating quickly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures it is also possible to recognize the face of the police officer who attacked with a single stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers how he strikes at Goiânia with his impact stock on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media activist from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics soon rush to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family living in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>

<seg id="610">The drawing was split multiple times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortelado invites further acts of violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás has experienced a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father because he had sabotaged the Occupy movement in secondary schools. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stick.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police grips for the police</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which there was brutal police raid against protesters last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers put in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where protesters had set up a stage for speakers, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP, Flavio Serafini, the Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from talking about violence against protesters.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have slipped the street protests by steering the focus on another unexpected protagonist: a windscreen.</seg>
<seg id="620">The following ha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo have specifically reported a broken glass window to illustratively design their front pages with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">You must also recognise this if you are strictly against any form of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too the term "vandalism" gets absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Disabled Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The congregation of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayonnque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no noteworthy sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succumbing, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that have been in operation after a long period of inactive time because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and barely competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that sugar could produce for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural Commissions" published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will go into history with safety," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavender." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">Over the next few years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats the most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents agree: not one of them has been informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be maintained, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of the reign, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially authored documents, which differed only concerning the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulf Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was taken over and the letters were more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the disused factory for two years and was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important worktop producer was extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the jobs and services that the plants were generating in the communities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut speech of October 21, 2002, the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory concluded, or rather, when they began to remove them, they also stopped to grasping the road, this also disadvantaged other enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grass Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo taken with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do it through Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop managers bring mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by pedagogue David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop will rise to the fact that the young participants discuss topics such as" "" "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance" "", "or whatever comes to mind." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen young women often disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences through globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebook page of N'we Jinan the stanza is available in transcript, as well a translation into English which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"" "" "" "so they can grow and go forward with our youth as well." ""</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, will be displayed next to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the "Plastische Models of the Courts") of each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce the plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is transforming them into striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger named itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist to shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new types decorated with plastic courts, as shown in Kichijoji Tokyo Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitsch collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food orders is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we have prepared for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing approach into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile stand and cell phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handyribbons from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more quirky plastic dishes, see: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the hashtag #, the other hand on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry, for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking," in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed completely the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each bone find behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with Drugs Trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vique que Cambian por el miedo" (german: "how afraid life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father looking for secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day.</seg>

<seg id="772">"" "where should we get them?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who are frightened. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a lady from Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to it or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) if he's big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about "heroic deeds" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the incapacity of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village could be justified with it that they were" "" "soaked" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirred and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"" "Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" "" "Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family was looted with threats." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested for you do not know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>

<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violent Generation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office counted 3103 killings. this corresponds to average 8.5 murder per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising up a rumor or flaring out a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been widely used to conduct tragedies occurring in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thereby devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, one of the tanker lorries fell victim to death.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials "representatives described a fireball which enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema close by, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the immeasurability.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture titled" "" "This is Nigeria." "" "the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized bodies that are strung on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically from atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a resident to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated visually.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again, when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal commentaries such as this example wrongly relate the picture of the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The painting from Sange appeared also in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning strike, published by the United Nations described those who could flee, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following are those who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture stems from an acidi-Arab news site, which falsely claimed President Myanmar's Thein Being, monks and politicians had taken part in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she used the image from DR Congo to make this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted Thein 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who were killed by Boko Haram published by the now deleted, Catholic near-standing news site Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the killings, but it claims that it constitutes a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>

<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo showed, along with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay more attention to those events that were presumed to be in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was taken as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved), but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="921">After a message that was allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it a hoax.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers no longer have faith in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are many people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">This mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that refusing images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images sensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study examining how violent media are acting on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss in the news media with regard to violent portrayals, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be replaced by the context or entirely improper nature.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take account of how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are necessary in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese, or Finnish words while the author and linguist from "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example, words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Do you care about your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>

<seg id="1132">We must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and unaware of the "other"; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March because the employment that we have no president, while he has already bombarded countries and "other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1135">History telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language storytelling initiative (TLS), learning stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS does not lie on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been running events since 2015, the risk that small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to" "" "is often associated to understanding" "" "use these events instead" "" "to appreciate, feel, touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, history narrators first introduce and translate their story in their own language and then explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their depiction lead to the fact that the audience settles on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke feelings of laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamenara tells the fable from the rabbit and the baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his cable, John Nyamamara is asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers are hoping to extend this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own storytelling stories.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3, 2017; the march started at the Republican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went until the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is organised in Berlin, dedicated itself to an event of the # FreeBasel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called Book Sprints, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Reflection).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and available royalty-free includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra Prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book titled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up from time to time extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra Prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "Military Police" "" "had taken on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on November 12, 2015, it was contacted by people who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and state remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bastion's cultural prototypes were more anticipatory than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crosscross of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles fuse with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to extinguish this architecture, which is not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life trying to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already detained.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a sample letter she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was detained.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Theodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 together with four other defendants for the embezzlement of 54 million Meets (around 800 000 euros) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company, which happened on April 19th.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not proceed with disciplinary proceedings after his arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not call this action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we note is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the contrary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, seems to have no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had subsided.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could consult and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Defenceless!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn't say anything about morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone would be rewarded in such a way that has already massively offended the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and serves the state. * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead has only served itself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took off their posts from the network, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censors the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the" "" "big" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (column), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobs Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty manner, whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "cure" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is convinced that she will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before combating all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write at Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the opposite words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all those who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship is often a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply going to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"" "" "" "Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists." ""</seg>

<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author commented on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook censorship has provided lots of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have emerged who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally address the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where thousands of Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to control the balancing hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar' it would have looked better on context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys among 19 were married from 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were striving to abolish laws on child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>

<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj pledged his intention to take court steps, the law was to be passed and he seems to have to undo his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al-wi, a proponent of the law, said it was perfectly legitimate if Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wanted to address the issue differently.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia site was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey is blocking the popular and popular cyclopedia based on crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology-savvy Internet users are used to using renaming tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been publishing articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as has recently been described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, periodical blockages of the internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was passed.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and often updated.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is also accessible despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the news (via blocking of Wikipedia), we are doing everything to put snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansippedi.org, an irrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar folders when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as collaborators at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One grabs another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission is used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to take a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepal to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) suddenly called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was on and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he was standing before face to tigers face to face face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can be bothered by the opinion of the sheep not when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when the king of the book suddenly appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares at me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ottern in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was authored by Kayonaaz KalyLawa and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, and fear of consequences should disregard the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state Odisha by a mock trial and rejected by her family and community after she had addressed a married family with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not to mention their wives is also common among men. however, they have far less penalties to fear, if at all what, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walsh in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, joined a unique club and quickly became the main conversation topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, run by the Video Volunteers community and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years Rohini Paese has been working with her video camera to expose practices, such as children's marriage up to the banishment of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their husbands on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the discussion about the patriarchy with a problem that women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud is a custom that they have kept all dutiful and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered a deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name, wanted to try at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to get the discussion going on with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paese from the village Walsh in Maharashtra on the Break of an age-old tradition in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only smoked in front of herself during the whole exercise; another chose to release the entire accumulated frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands at their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation artfully resulted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinaped red dot on the forehead that shows the EhStoratus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women just have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would carry the zinapberred dot if he would do it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but think that they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip for each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to tell you certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salem-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they didn't get married.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morale associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled its own pair of kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Rohini attests to the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club has changed:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and there are no other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at all times.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - are at the end of a hard-to-navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turnaround in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, remarked in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The cult band's music is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles Commemorative Day in Japan. at the age of 51, they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of persons for organ trafficking, probably for disbelieving purposes, concerns the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the Malawian border.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and a part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the bodies of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth, explained the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men have been registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country has conducted a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1596">Attention to kahle men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, warned the Mosambique police according to the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the assassinations took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husked Algy Adamo, student and inhabitant of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police had already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably devout rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last few days three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the Chronik der Bloggers arms Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHED GERNE EIN Mosambique, THE SME is ashamed of a country in which people would be ashamed to have sex against good marks, and to make sex against good marks, a country where people would not hurt sincere pursuits or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country where neither the albinos nor bald or bald people would be hunted, which aim to attain rapid wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of them missed the opportunity for macabre humor.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced late June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion, "having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "" "internal affair" "" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Yet, China continues to obtain calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or permit him to treat him abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Liu a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and the Netherlands</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon trap to China, as the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union and the European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as she announced in an announcement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to freely communicate with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message asks the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy asked a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley stated that China should offer the following to the couple:</seg>

<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in the news agency Reuters reported that China had great concerns whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and the Caribbean</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called China to provide adequate medical care to Liu and give him the opportunity to be worried about his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's attorney told AFP previously that Liu wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and to contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum further talks:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada also urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression and freedom of expression.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and Germany</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry asked China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he is. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information on whether France would eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan free of charge</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan asked China on June 27 to release Liu and show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the diseased intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 around Liu and indicated that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">"" "" "" "this remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere." ""</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Cavalierio blog blamed the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian performance in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one hears that we are ultimately no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the Singapore political system with other "normal countries" in view of this, it inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently waged by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the issue, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the distorted logic as they are better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests about our press, our judiciary, our political system, really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised these questions with non-replies of rational fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points to the criticisms that one should start reading the full transcript of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unimportant even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who makes such polemical statement as leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed by what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes that is right and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "faithfully commit a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country does the sovereign rights of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the Cabinet's cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore afford their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human identity card?</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos, which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before entering an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in jail, because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez directs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-colored earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mom Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the way through.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2,50 per night, guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mommy Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, buying them medicines that they can't pay, they massage them with a balsam the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurtbeard) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking about Mrs. Ramírez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil earlier and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mother Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is maybe very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to follow the next steps.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, travellers always consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">She flips like a proud grandmother in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair ties she made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she introduces herself to me.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang from Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi have received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web purification").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged news with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the police announcement, the app was able to identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web sites, online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" remote "remote" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to monitor the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, constrained ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China," the censored news published in China, displayed photos of a checkpoint where policemen subsequently checked the residents whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the abuse technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the City Council of Ministers to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office to operate their computers and communications equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued an order on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at local police until August 1.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"" "the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" "" "terrorist" "" "videos. however, this action violates Urumquis's personality rights of three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."

<seg id="2068">Your executioner is rejoicing in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him, so they exchanged the tube through a cable.</seg>

<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them changed while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noted the cooling and did not take any pleasure in doing so, which is why he was next to an electrically charged bar.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smokes cigarettes in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he shuffles to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which belongs to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib family to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as felahyeen (e.g.: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and question their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and raptorial music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are relevant not only in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that extend from Damascus in Syria up to the whole of Yemen in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special reluctance against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as a second generation Palestinian - he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he dissolved into water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sensing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the gap of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, drinking water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan canceled an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinnai contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had" "" "just" "" "been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which questioned the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to "advocate" intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be just rhetorical rhetoric, but can indeed reflect an increasingly clear, crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib revived traditional sex men by educating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a seemingly comforting unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years, the number of" "" "Honour murders" "" "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside left." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan does not have institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 crime control law, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence can be kept in prison for an indefinite period of time, "and for their release many years of bureaucratic effort and a guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to shy away from topics that are long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, a man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">Politics was intimidated, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated conspicuously:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it too." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words," "" "that can get what you want" "" "- be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians in Jordan and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to memorize later that his commentaries were torn, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly recruiting the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nude, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service noted several former governmental delegates and members of the teacher association, stating that they have critically commented on the problems linked to the corruption deep down in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that's how Hdaib - is made up of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, like millions of other Arabs, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not through bombs, cluster munitions and artificially-induced democracies. at least he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to carry on and therefore also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which was owned by Aman as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Nebat Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the solid trolleys, the drums and the dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the West marched into the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the emissi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is difficult to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outer appearances and personal care rarely have been as important as in this history, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street raub and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the outlandish hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers, who can reproduce these lavish hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the hairdresser's "Batalla de Barberos" competition, which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts confront each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy school, which is located in El Callao, have an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice to get an education in the hairdresser's art that enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of her achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monthly.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the" "" "love message to guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the International online magazine Tea Party After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign "Carta por la reconciliación" (letters to reconciliation) encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their land was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the FARC (German: Revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the point of view of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Colombians there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and, around the clock, had their weapons with them, now have to integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now enter its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who are to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation began at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people that needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC emerged as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between," said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Cauca, described this unforgettable experience like this:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Camelbooks" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go there, because beside him there was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he said," "" "I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices for new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the outset, students and some leaders of the FARC met for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">This is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have witnessed how social injustice on the part of the state was affecting the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people, including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were made to believe that peace would prevail after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we at the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>

<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had heard everything and began to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which patient's wings have you been placed - in the men's or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some told me I needed to prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad address, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish I can't overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually make an effort to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have lain dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had sat in argun for a month and a half.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during the Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not finish a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">This is what I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: aren't even gay men arrested in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to execute Kadyrows Judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, but were specifically immersed in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we assume that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called non-traditional orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, before 2003 I was already known in Grosny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer then than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to bring us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but finally threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia never insulted me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people as I met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't worry about another's misfortune."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never insulted me, never chased nor struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could sense how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I returned home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, meetings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I applauded refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeaway?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature which has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestaners have which, the cabards have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I become so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew back the desperate situation of the Arabic Ahrazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he ashamed of his own helplessness that could arise for his family, so Ahrazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video posted on YouTube kept the moments when he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arabic Ahrazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have appealed this month.</seg>

<seg id="2410">Arab ancestry suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arabic Ahrazi community resides in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arabian Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most productive and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often a victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has refused to systematically refuse the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams to divert the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to exacerbating the devastation caused by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youth now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are seeking employment, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and have a university degree of 45%.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohii, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among the young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arabic Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their native country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname in order to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and be employed in such a way as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab attire.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arabic Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists Alarm alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissar said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena showed her maltreatment, the actentious ad of Ada Báez used nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved back her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women complain at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must contact the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to see how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research facility in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the district prosecutor's office attracted 9600 ads on domestic violence. 70% of it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace courts. also here, 86% of the ads were reported by women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's ministries Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is reimbursed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>

<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal offense, law enforcement agencies cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she asked. this should be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she carried out mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would ever be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that the only women who are too submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming a name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had so long enjoyed Carlos and didn't leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mistreated them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") composed of women who are all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements for the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an impenetrable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Nononless) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes to explain Femizid to an independent criminal law and to punish tougher as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the law text was modified in a number of ways in order to win the deputies for the law that feared that the path for decriminalisation of abortions would be levelled, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and are punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill intended to pay the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear, if they simply want to report and provide secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreation is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his permission</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, a large number of medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare sector, covering special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for the Study of Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed its first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sambian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the main focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Q: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay a receiver instead of being a mover himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Q: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Q: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Q: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Q: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">Rw: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines use articles only against payment (the so-called "Paywall") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how open-source seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been cultivating salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work has been set by its own ingenuity and the question of how many varieties of salad it can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents go not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curly leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still cultivating salad, but it now takes longer since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if there is a boulder in a river to mate." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "this is what we have to do now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented. "he makes as good as possible and tries to breed those traits that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful, however, and endeavours not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" "breeders)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station have bred and ate red Roman salad of the Outrageous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station, where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the use of other seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds, to breed it, to breed their own varieties and not to hie it immediately - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">The professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Board Member Jack Kloppenburg are control over seed and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to seeds, seed play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds," says he, and takes care of the increasingly frequent mergers in the global agricultural industry. "whoever wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the growing number of intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is thus always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director of Ossi, has been working in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all carrot traits are protected as intellectual property, thereby making it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or at all.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no estimates for other plants yet, but experts such as Luby suspect that large-scale cultivated plants such as wheat are still patented in an even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders does away with more and more patents. at present, genetic diversity is more needed than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperating with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection therefore does not inhibit innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to be able to grow on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to be:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "as a whole, Morton interferes with the concept of using plant features:" "" "we do not really create the features themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in Oregon and Ossi's member of the board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds one species, also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create the majority of smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the experimentation or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders, Frank Morton, looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"" "in addition, Morton believes that farmers would be more innovative by avoiding plant patrons:" "" "it looks like I am stronger than companies with my efforts to produce new products." ""</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves," "" "he says." "" "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, with which you think it is quite easy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the open source breeding, the concept now spreads quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is launching an open-source seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5th August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "August published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities strongly criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its aim to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these objectives, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera due to the alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human Rights Organization of the wave of website blocking to the victim. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Apart from ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he directed to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which also is home to Canada's blog, is accessible on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting about the student protests and recording a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced the government's blockage and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Those who lock blogs is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelimtah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They managed to convey me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, a summons from the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after having closed it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">It also documented the blocking of providers caused by the circumvention of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the decision-making decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will they attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army is in use in the favelas in Niterói, a city in Rio de Janeiro, during the governmental crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers report in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day, a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves rob the pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and airways to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the 2017 violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "in this way, the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio, published on August 16, published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision like this:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crime, etc. everything that deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when distorted, can also be used to disguise atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecina Oliveira contradicts the violence as a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult to hold accountable to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"" "" "" "this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of the public service." ""</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the murder rate per state, Rio is on number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">For years, Globo, the largest media company in South America, has said that, as Cecina has stressed, the state's security policy has been repeated for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these security policy measures was the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police custody and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several reports, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports about harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho, in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to the victories Watch, a common initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently about a million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding countries, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, those areas controlled by rebel forces have been under siege outside Damascus, leading to the need for local residents or through tunnels and control points to be smuggled.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food-based foods in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, its foods make them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged east Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Direkt of the project, Abo Nabil, said to AFP, the French news agency:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the cultivation of mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many major cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government calling for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also recorded in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 explosions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in Pedrógão Grande, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Cruz, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the party Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been assassinated by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt protective.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hatred for the Hazara came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf returned to Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little reward, and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf sold his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous voyage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">For some time, Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to people in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high demand rates Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers have in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3,000" "" "special reception centres" "", "which are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum, which can go for months after registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it happened to Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbounded loneliness helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf made his entire savings to the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (English: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans have developed companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan Enterpriser Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp in Padua. there are also Afghans behind the Kabulogna pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashareholes's goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy sector and retailers and aim back to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, opportunities are also opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also plans to make plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and performance techniques." "" "they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the evacuation of the Camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Neoliath Report is an international snapshot that displays challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that foresees that users can only use social media, such as Twitter or Facebook, only after a registration by a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register in order to be able to use social networks, register within six months after the submission of the legislation on the website of the authority stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step may be sentenced to up to six months "imprisonment or the termination of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committees of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce tougher sanctions for the insult of the president or a high official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, such action would, however, be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the impeachment of elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting for four years in prison for more than 700 protest participants arrested at the same incident.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the prison line, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused away from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, the pseudo-burden of, among other things, possession of weapons, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza declared the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosmad al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting to the pro-Morsi blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the sanctions imposed by journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist interrogated to scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has been largely interrogated to a guaranteed plan of action. according to the plan, the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill that would ensure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali accused of corruption, provided they return all illegally received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document released on April 21, on the Nawaat website, sheds light on how the presidential plans for support of the legislation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on 9th May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations by the Information Bureau of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also specified in the rules that the registration with full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks. it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app weChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roscompnadzor, WeChat failed to register as an" "" "organizer of the dissemination of information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and forcing them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclassiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, mail.ru mail service and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocked Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias block in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication had been blocked because it became" "" "an information source" "" "working with groups to create a political defamatory campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website, which is, among other things, China, one of the few countries worldwide, where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop knotting herpes</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install tools that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civil population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until the 19th of May. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
