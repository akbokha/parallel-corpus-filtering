this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally heard tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and p@@ onder@@ ing journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ tigen they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they had years to declare that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to aw@@ nings .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and the sources can hide less and less .
instead of failing to make statements and aw@@ nings , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his telephone inquiries secretly ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit return , and even travel agencies with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens put@@ ative source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments together .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as government technology permits to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today , there are communications software that didn &apos;t exist yet , when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous , the Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site as shown here by the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
it is important for us to ensure that not only technology men , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have an opportunity to bring out mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to report ab@@ uses in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer who alarm the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall @-@ insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data leak in history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a saying : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s mail@@ box companies have in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trail of US $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cello player .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and the next revealed documents .
Hi , of course this post is genuinely nice and I have learned lot of things from it on the topic of blo@@ gging . thanks . Od@@ po@@ ve@@ da@@ Å¥
it seems to be we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why should we do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are being used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have so far been no prominent American who occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but due to the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US countries , there is less information needed to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we were really shocked that all of us had made a suggestion to our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course no one was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , wrapped up in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that may sound very glo@@ omy , as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite well that some things have started to change .
in the past few years , we have seen bre@@ aches of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been operating in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US la@@ gs behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both chambers of Parliament , but it does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo @-@ firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in business who rise up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which is now allowing this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
a day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go to the cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the blanket and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed , sne@@ aking at the toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood actually were friends who only waited to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I went to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am job@@ less , almost broke , my room@@ mate prefers , and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into being fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how to earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ gi@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it .
this is how we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website that people post public images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when a visit is over .
over the Internet , they can invite strangers to stay overnight .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still with sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children , we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
when one has a problem , one senses the things that one can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel - it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design achieve something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we were striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left neighbour .
this sil@@ ky way of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like so , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is can@@ did@@ oting for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he came , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you have to give your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system rein@@ forces confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence .
not surprisingly , we trust most of the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
if one has less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation seems to have simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; say too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimum degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m going on holiday with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first of all : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
the business is going very well for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who illeg@@ ally celebrated parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I stood on the front line when confidence was broken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , 123 million over@@ nights spent only a fraction of a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
if trust works , there can be wonders .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay is running .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
this is an economic transaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it can be compared to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait a lot to fill a thoroughly and show one at a bar @-@ trip neighborhood you &apos;ve never heard of before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and amor@@ tis@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already been started . many car parks belonging to the government ,
they were now offered to residents . students looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were withdrawn . incub@@ ator programmes have been launched ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host .
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re @-@ invent the wheel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hospitality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also available before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think this is amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a MÃ¶@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was faith and slow submission , which deep@@ ened with each reading of the Koran .
the beauty of rhythm makes me cry sometimes .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone is perc@@ ei@@ ving you , understands you fully , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped from the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do this ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... ... &quot; ... D@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me from a citizen to a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and begin the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember when we went sil@@ ently -- as deep as I went into my seat , and I feared for the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ame not you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside for the whole week .
then there was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were un@@ filtered understand@@ ably , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslims to be free and beating .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain themselves .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community as a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is found as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it may unlock a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me , people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their congregation , even from their family , so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ one with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense in their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic trials -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of governance , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if test persons are presenting news reports in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you see when the mood sw@@ ings upwards against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two bal@@ lot periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has sensible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when assign@@ ing collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental department , talented , promising a lot ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did I become such a sav@@ age young man from my little brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited her in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to give to our children : one that would control us by fear or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove quietly , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went to the hall of prayer , and what I saw was stopped .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought forward courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might say that you are going to hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind@@ set , an exception rather than the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ adi@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one looks at the Muslims around the world , and I did so with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when people appear like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ adi@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion @-@ dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air pack@@ ers came into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting planes , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build up load @-@ bearing structures independently .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where mobile objects are located in space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rear starter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an aircraft that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of tail@@ stocks is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air unit does not matter in what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often face basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flight devices , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying is working with just one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote controlled flight machine . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and can move everywhere in the room .
yet it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I must throw it right .
the chance to throw it right when I see all is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in seclu@@ sion , this machine here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , is an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is first symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
in this way he receives the extraordinary ability to :
moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly even if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine on Broadway would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
about 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes conver@@ ged in a very far distant galax@@ y , transforming the mass of three suns in one tenth second in pure energy .
this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first classi@@ fy the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell lives were created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God even stands at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group of especially dar@@ ede@@ vil@@ s - Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed the idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vity Wave Observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o increased considerably , which greatly improved recognition performance .
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to solve some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes ero@@ ded through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my death sick father .
basically it was the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ us@@ k in the structure of space and time .
when over@@ taking the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other .
instruc@@ ts in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a real al@@ ber@@ ish dance .
&quot; stretching and st@@ acking , stretching and st@@ acking . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ amped when the waves were hit . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os following the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o staff said to be crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because this allows you to create an image or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you from several points .
this is different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that particularly mean to you :
for example , your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by observing changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we trans@@ mu@@ te wave pattern in sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has occupied himself for quite a long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , circul@@ arly simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render Sound &#93; No one who knows what he must listen to , recognis@@ es this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing a whole new way to resear@@ ching the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space we can - practically or basically -- not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes , however , happen at the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by its own light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea of . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things in the first attempt that we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like lig@@ o observed them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the no@@ od@@ les for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the formation of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , removed my fear .
my fear of talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes that pro@@ found@@ ly changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , is called all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for un@@ expla@@ in@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ fund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked her if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very ti@@ ring .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , stir you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
I do TV , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each stream has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that are simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America , my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I don &apos;t just walk around the computer and fanta@@ sies , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not about dre@@ aming at a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , everything blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m absorbed into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
so as if you were wearing a high sound , you should deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ Ã© .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I declare them the sums that I am writing about writing that writing is a joy for me .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the tot@@ um -- when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the tot@@ um !
the tot@@ um is more than writing .
the tot@@ um is action and activity . the tot@@ um is a drug .
the tot@@ um is music . the tot@@ um is light and air .
the tot@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a hum@@ ming then you can do no differently than by size .
the feeling of not being different than to strive for size no matter what price .
this is called the tot@@ um .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps ego is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the tot@@ um .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more things work at the same time , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectation there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the tot@@ um .
I need the tot@@ um . I am the tot@@ um .
am I just this sum ?
and then the tot@@ um stopped .
over@@ worked , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the tot@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single stit@@ utable .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ anic .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum ceased .
the tot@@ um of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the tot@@ um did not come back .
my tot@@ um was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , do not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pioneer Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the tot@@ um and the tot@@ um I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ eive yourself , stupid author @-@ titanium &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you work , you love what you do , be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the hum@@ ming , if you know the hum@@ ming already , if you stop the hum@@ ming already , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become clear to me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and smo@@ ther my tot@@ um , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is going to loose , or whatever the girl releases in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost is coming in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly comes back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s silent , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the tot@@ um , but a tot@@ um .
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the Tit@@ an@@ izing sums , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real tot@@ um is .
the tot@@ um is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum is dependent on love .
the tot@@ um is the current that comes from the lust for life .
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sum is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the tot@@ um again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not in the way I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at work than at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person prefers to be rather than a house ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of that .
we are racing around in the garden , forward and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
in doing so , I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ um of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ Ã¤fer or cookie replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the track !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my wellness oasis , my world . they do not have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m going through and I &apos;m victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to beat myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a bit , why not treat yourself to full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the tot@@ um came back in my spare time . the hum@@ ming then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy is pouring in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . it leads me to new ideas .
I like the tot@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the h@@ um , the hum@@ ming is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my tot@@ um .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but only one part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s snow@@ ing to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , who is playing a journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the luck@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the tot@@ ality . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the h@@ um , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the tot@@ um of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life is spreading within me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel that hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I am thinking about things , I &apos;ll get you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ am@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the best known ones , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; they im@@ planted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurological function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
you have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain with skull @-@ brain trauma and increases the cran@@ ial pressure .
in order to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this , you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois managed .
he saw it under his microscope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the embry@@ onic stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain lesi@@ ons in higher concentrations .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois did .
and then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the final step , we re @-@ planted them at the point of origin of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ use these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we carry the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with monkey .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we inserted an injury and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we used in vitro to color in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we got the motor motor range in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some extent , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey relaxing spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since then we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill in about two kilograms of paper and forms to pass through this type of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
first of all , it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Y@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West are making a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to regard them as un@@ changeable gran@@ deur .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy in fact disappears with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I became un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group will succ@@ um@@ b to a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are mur@@ der@@ ers , our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tw@@ ins of tw@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is part of the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , however , are too timi@@ d to invest where it would be productive and bring income , with which one could take off the debt mountain and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , $ 3.4 billion spent in the US , England and the euro@@ zone have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on .
$ 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until it is compared to the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise property prices .
thus debts and non @-@ productive capital form the twin cul@@ min@@ ates , which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand , which , as in an endless loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of the investors who do not invest .
invol@@ un@@ tarily takes the circumstances leading to the k@@ ills him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
his very wast@@ eful kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and to finance particularly all the technologies , &quot; green technologies &quot; which are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , rested too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they occupied the working arms , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal votes in matters of state occupation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also burnt out quickly .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in Ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only emerged as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , while the economy gradually under@@ mines politics and escap@@ es it .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because nowadays it can be in the government and still not in power , because the power has shifted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s about as a herd of predat@@ ors that so sustain@@ ably the animals they feed on has dec@@ im@@ ated that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy which has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ med politics that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the general economic demand falls , and the corporate managers are too scar@@ ed to invest in the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins of tw@@ ins , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring back the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and social conflicts more deeply , just as I think -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we must resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the fields of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified sector , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyp@@ er that lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks , dev@@ our the meaning of life .
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples shortly .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and proceeds from revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no more differentiation between those that the companies belong , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not owned by the company . no more exchange between capital and labor , no big gaps between investment and spar@@ es , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin @-@ tops .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a vac@@ ill@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 greatest emerging economies &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
if you continue to imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency , we call them &quot; the cosmos , &quot; units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which it fav@@ ors privileged persons , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are we going to sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also totally spinning .
BG : in fact , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not spinning , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said it . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a way , if I dare say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar today to the 19th century England .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was very scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to blame China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells great after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro area ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to ourselves , and the continuing den@@ ial of a massive fault line through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- who , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes happen it will happen ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- sincer@@ ely ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the proposal for extending the debt recovery programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the exposed pilots will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most people have never heard of Roy Price although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and refers to Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is receiving .
if your show is rated 9 and above , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make addic@@ ts , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and votes eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon gives out things for nothing , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are being watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts are ski@@ pping or looking at again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process these and hence the answer arises , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 - so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team watched the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , so the reviews they give to the shows , the course of which shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what &apos;s going on here ?
it has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work in such a way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we can use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this space . if you come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of sav@@ vy firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams swiftly into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people use a lot of data uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably to make serious decisions , such as deciding on cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things :
first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into its components , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together again in order to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to be put together again even if the information is incomplete , especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you &apos;d like to replace it with something much smar@@ ter than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
