<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had illegally heard telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and pondering journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mutigen they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had years to declare that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to awnings.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and the sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to make statements and awnings, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his telephone inquiries secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit return, and even travel agencies with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risens putative source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments together.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology permits to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communications software that didn't exist yet, when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous, the Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site as shown here by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that threaten us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important for us to ensure that not only technology men, such as Edward Snowden, have an opportunity to bring out misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report abuses in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental officer who alarm the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall-insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leak in history was published.] [the Panama Papers "reveal that rich and powerful] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca saying: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's mailbox companies have in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trail of US $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cello player.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Hi, of course this post is genuinely nice and I have learned lot of things from it on the topic of blogging. thanks. Odpovedať</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "why should we do that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are being used by a few to hide and obscure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryoshka.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have so far been no prominent American who occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US countries, there is less information needed to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We were really shocked that all of us had made a suggestion to our investigators how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course no one was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, wrapped up in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound very gloomy, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite well that some things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen breaches of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been operating in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both chambers of Parliament, but it does not make the progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo-firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in business who rise up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the intransparency which is now allowing this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go to the corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while paying the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I lay in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed, sneaking at the toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood actually were friends who only waited to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I went to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am jobless, almost broke, my roommate prefers, and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create fear into being fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how to earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created "air mattress and breakfast" [Airbed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blegiczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is how we presented the investors: "we want to create a website that people post public images from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when a visit is over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite strangers to stay overnight.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still with solace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children, we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When one has a problem, one senses the things that one can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel - it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design achieve something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silky way of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like so, who now has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidoting for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told whence he came, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements that all say: "he can really hold on very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you have to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system reinforces confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust most of the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation seems to have similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "say too much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother --" "" "-- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimum degree of openness, such as "great works of art in your home! I'm going on holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is going very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who illegally celebrated parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"" "" "" "I stood on the front line when confidence was broken." ""</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, 123 million overnights spent only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, there can be wonders.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic transaction.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it can be compared to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group there would wait a lot to fill a thoroughly and show one at a bar-trip neighborhood you've never heard of before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and amortisation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already been started. many car parks belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">They were now offered to residents. students looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were withdrawn. incubator programmes have been launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't re-invent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"" "" "" "hospitality" "" "was also available before." ""</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think this is amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>

<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>

<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was faith and slow submission, which deepened with each reading of the Koran.</seg>

<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt that someone is perceiving you, understands you fully, and yet somehow loves?</seg>

<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>

<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam...... "... Djihad..."... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me from a citizen to a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to go through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and begin the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember when we went silently -- as deep as I went into my seat, and I feared for the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="320">"" "nowadays we can actually hear people say," "" "There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community as a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is found as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may unlock a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their congregation, even from their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux clone with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergyman with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense in their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific trials -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of governance, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if test persons are presenting news reports in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood swings upwards against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two ballot periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to give to our children: one that would control us by fear or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we drove quietly, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went to the hall of prayer, and what I saw was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come, not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought forward courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself, what do you say to those who might say that you are going to hold a TEDTalk, a thinker with a draught, working in a noble mindset, an exception rather than the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogadied: I would say you don't deceive yourself. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at the Muslims around the world, and I did so with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion-dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packers came into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1,500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting planes, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up load-bearing structures independently.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively known where mobile objects are located in space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level e. g." "" "Start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"" "this is a so-called" "" "rear starter" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailstocks is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air unit does not matter in what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flight devices, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying is working with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote controlled flight machine. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Yet it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to get it to fly, I must throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to throw it right when I see all is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in seclusion, this machine here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is first symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way he receives the extraordinary ability to:</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it rotates or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine on Broadway would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">About 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes converged in a very far distant galaxy, transforming the mass of three suns in one tenth second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit up brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first classify the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell lives were created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God even stands at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of especially daredevils - Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed the idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- Gravity Wave Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of Ligo increased considerably, which greatly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to solve some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes eroded through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and their observatories like ligo measurable signals for 23 years. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crusk in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When overtaking the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Instructs in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a real alberish dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and stacking, stretching and stacking."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stamped when the waves were hit. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros following the comma, followed by a 1. that's why the Ligo staff said to be crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because this allows you to create an image or a map of things by perceiving the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">This is different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that particularly mean to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by observing changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we transmute wave pattern in sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has occupied himself for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circularly simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirp with an additional key change. that sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- ligo heard the following: [Surrender Sound] No one who knows what he must listen to, recognises this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving a whole new way to researching the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can - practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes, however, happen at the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, since the Big Bang is obscured by its own light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea of. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things in the first attempt that we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like ligo observed them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the noodles for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the formation of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You can dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that profoundly changed my life to an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, is called all" "" "kittens" "", "for unexplainable reasons." ""</seg>

<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on I swore to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tiring.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "Yes" "" "say to play with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each stream has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that are simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I don't just walk around the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I understand that it is not about dreaming at a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, everything blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm absorbed into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as if you were wearing a high sound, you should deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare them the sums that I am writing about writing that writing is a joy for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totum -- when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the totum!</seg>
<seg id="618">The totum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totum is action and activity. the totum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totum is music. the totum is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a humming then you can do no differently than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than to strive for size no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the totum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps ego is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the totum.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more things work at the same time, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectation there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the totum, the totum, the totum.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the totum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the totum. I am the totum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the totum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overworked, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mommy is a single stitutable.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sum ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The totum of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My totum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regret, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, do not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pioneer Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the totum and the totum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think," "" "Receive yourself, stupid author-titanium" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you work, you love what you do, be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the humming, if you know the humming already, if you stop the humming already, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late, and she says:" "" "mum, you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become clear to me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she does not call anyone" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and smother my totum, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humming, I can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is going to loose, or whatever the girl releases in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's silent, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totum, but a totum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the Titanizing sums, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real totum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totum is the current that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the totum again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not in the way I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a person prefers to be rather than a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of that.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are racing around in the garden, forward and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no need for more.</seg>

<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellness oasis, my world. they do not have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming of having a place for peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy is pouring in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. it leads me to new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the totum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>

<seg id="778">It's snowing to me that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, who is playing a journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the best known ones, the "deep brain stimulation." they implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease suffering from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain swells the brain with skull-brain trauma and increases the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this, you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the embryonic stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain lesions in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the final step, we re-planted them at the point of origin of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-use these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we carry the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we inserted an injury and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we used in vitro to color in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of dexterity, we got the motor motor range in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some extent, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey relaxing spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since then we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implore them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>

<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West are making a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to regard them as unchangeable grandeur.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Democracy in fact disappears with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I became unequivocally clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup will succumb to a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are murderers, our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twins of twins" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is part of the wealthy depositors and corporations, however, are too timid to invest where it would be productive and bring income, with which one could take off the debt mountain and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, $3.4 billion spent in the US, England and the eurozone have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3,4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until it is compared to the $5.1 trillion US dollar spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate the stock markets and raise property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and non-productive capital form the twin culminates, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low aggregate demand, which, as in an endless loop, encourages the pessimism of the investors who do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily takes the circumstances leading to the kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His very wasteful kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and to finance particularly all the technologies, "green technologies" which are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">"" "" "" "Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority." ""</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, rested too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that they occupied the working arms, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with equal votes in matters of state occupation.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the Athenian democracy has not lasted long --" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is also burnt out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies did not have their roots in Ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only emerged as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, while the economy gradually undermines politics and escapes it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it can be in the government and still not in power, because the power has shifted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's about as a herd of predators that so sustainably the animals they feed on has decimated that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy which has so far cannibalmed politics that it harms itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are depreciated, the general economic demand falls, and the corporate managers are too scared to invest in the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twins of twins, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring back the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste more sublime, and social conflicts more deeply, just as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we must reshape the economy and reunite the fields of business and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified sector, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyper that lets the film" "" "matrix" "" "appear like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix," in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," in long talks, devour the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples shortly.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and proceeds from revenue, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No more differentiation between those that the companies belong, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not owned by the company. no more exchange between capital and labor, no big gaps between investment and spares, and ultimately no uplifting twin-tops.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a vacillating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 greatest emerging economies], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">If you continue to imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency, we call them "the cosmos," units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberally, in which it favors privileged persons, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or are we going to sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also totally spinning.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not spinning, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said it. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a way, if I dare say so provocative, China is similar today to the 19th century England.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To blame China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells great after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro area,</seg>

<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>

<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes happen it will happen abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead of?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>

<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everybody who looks back -- sincerely...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the proposal for extending the debt recovery programme at the end of February.</seg>

<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to propose the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most people have never heard of Roy Price although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and refers to Twitter as "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is receiving.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated 9 and above, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that make addicts, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price doesn't care about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to undermine" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium output, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon makes something like that, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and votes eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out things for nothing, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are being watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts are skipping or looking at again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact they collect the data, process these and hence the answer arises, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 - so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team watched the existing data about the Netflix spectators, so the reviews they give to the shows, the course of which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has hit a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what's going on here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work in such a way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time where we can use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this space. if you come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of savvy firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams swiftly into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people use a lot of data unimaginably to make serious decisions, such as deciding on cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever need to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you disassemble this problem into its components, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items together again in order to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to be put together again even if the information is incomplete, especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when competing for TV ideas, when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you'd like to replace it with something much smarter than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
