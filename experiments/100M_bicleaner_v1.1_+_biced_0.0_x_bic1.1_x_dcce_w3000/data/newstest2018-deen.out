Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an asylum @-@ institution where young people are to meet today .
a pit chapel , now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gro@@ wers manage the erst@@ while ground of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich fav@@ ours exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows this , who had to get upset already , because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but actual - but very enligh@@ tening .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and churches in the area of the Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet , which one does not recognize as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called prototype sheets , were incorporated into the large map of the map for cities and municipalities .
according to the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ gem@@ ungs@@ verwaltung from 18@@ 10 to 18@@ 64 , these were created and originate from the first sur@@ veying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , the French army chief occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally with@@ drew from Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9th , 18@@ 01 , they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ) .
the comparison of early / present is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is the sub @-@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a district of Munich .
today , the city is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered flat@@ lands from the so @-@ called &quot; Uran@@ ium &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
small plots of land today do not occupy any farmers anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; Land in Sun &quot; plant .
a large green area is located north of the sub @-@ send@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the present @-@ day district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street names &quot; at the guest house &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district .
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ mad@@ house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and , for example , ended the so @-@ called Irish anchor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was initially room , later on 500 places were extended .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ ro@@ scope in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet now on the premises of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
the football field of TS@@ V Munich East is located west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - in an architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ it@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line was carried out .
with the slider the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
Om@@ bud@@ sman publishes travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Far@@ ming has issued a warning to colourful people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Council for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of du@@ bi@@ ous , race @-@ based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and noted here , &quot; says the Group .
a recently adopted version of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the government &apos;s prosecution authorities that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , prompted the group to publish the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US .
the group quoted incidents like rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during his journey through the state and was put into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Bureau of Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s General Prosecutor , shown that black mot@@ orists are detained in the state 75 percent more often than white people .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be prepared to bring money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s Hass@@ an Cri@@ mes Report , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view of further racial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher pasture @-@ fence @-@ project is a success @-@ project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary representatives Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac obtained a picture on the spot .
at the justice @-@ grab@@ bing of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ branch meet together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first gave insights into his farm , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses the holiday homes in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profitable on such steep faces .
the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot of things have to be edited with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ lizers , even if it does not lead to organic farming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader &apos;s promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the re@@ forest@@ ation of the area could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced .
the exhibition area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half was promoted via leader , a quarter contributed the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and rural women it &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art Baden @-@ Württemberg offers state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art production of wheat f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a spec@@ ul@@ ator referred to by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the adjacent surface must not be smu@@ g@@ gled ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electric fence project 2018 , there is currently an application for eight participants with 24 plots that would like to build a fence of just under 16 kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exhibition area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciated these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restrictions on legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not grasp the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ meas@@ ur@@ ers would have liked him if he had done it .
but he assumed their importance , and in particular the importance of which it was attributed , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta proc@@ eeded , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a whole thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , your afflicted masses who cra@@ ve to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not get involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that she had completed a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism , presenting in a worn @-@ out classical representation portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite un@@ usually , Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across something here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a matter of point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ earning but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the deck of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue tells them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not light the path , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ dges Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
the Director of Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics needs to learn from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to keep it up until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler@@ - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m line while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain by the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their talk was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought together naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , competing at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les in their fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the short @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir runs along this road and last year set up five British and two European records .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which you should watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team captain commented that she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but also in some cases also be involved in the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to sit on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the elec@@ ting of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the papers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he le@@ ap@@ ed with criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this fact at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a back@@ lash with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Ser@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing in the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest quoted the Bible in his mail and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focused spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control articles or arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what exactly happens digital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County har@@ med the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable portion had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes to enjoy domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for domestic comfort within the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he settled this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the promotion at home .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking of lung cancer .
this is the result of researchers at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Head of Study Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße is in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
traffic , which ham@@ pers the construction work again and again , represents a major problem for the Bau@@ tru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off lights is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ est@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ga@@ ete , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the troubled Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a roof @-@ less room is used as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces by a public shift .
an existing movement which stir@@ red up the independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea contained the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
the town , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo groves and corrugated sheets , which were converted by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined the worth of US $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Mozambique also has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
pap@@ rika calls for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua has been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report from the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese in 2016 , reported in the report on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung ch@@ urch@@ ins sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people struggle to keep up with it .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cost the local Papua New Mama @-@ M@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ h@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter made 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua has little changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ v@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ o@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ga@@ ete , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights on .
one of the soldiers took an attack on their clay and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ les , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua people , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - running in a circle and im@@ porting a song of birds - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to hur@@ l stones at police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated up , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias kay@@ ak , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ga@@ ete , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and asked the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his color@@ fully painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ am still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , was hit three times , according to his c@@ ousin who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in a dark atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ co , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news of the kill@@ ings only arrived on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , Security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , saying that he has no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; charged more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with a gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear of years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus informed that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police shot at villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones to officers who responded by firing warnings .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killed a crowd .
&quot; we were so in panic , we were afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , such as TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called for an account of the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a disaster for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by provo@@ king spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in R@@ arot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is also out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire Airport .
the few jobs in the region are usually due to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , although they were given the rare permit for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ h@@ is campaign to highlight the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful eastern provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government largely remains restricted to Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia still holds a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous .
in 2019 , Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ h@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blame &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties led to a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of an victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when people cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that fighting fire fighters against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished fire and cooled down the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident may rev@@ ital@@ ise questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage occurred from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and facing in London &apos;s Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this Sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning hands was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but even therefore very estimated five @-@ set classics remain so preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform , the aim of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member@@ ships did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal had not yet come to the vote , to carry out the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in the first round , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey of flight passengers concluded that more than 20 percent were smu@@ g@@ gled or un@@ consciously forbidden items at the control points of the US Transportation security administration , including at least 6 percent , who entered the aircraft as they acci@@ dentally carried prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had late discovered that they had gone wrong with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted with more than 1,000 people , carried out by a Jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those sur@@ vey@@ ed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were mill@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were pur@@ pos@@ ely passed down to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of female sur@@ vey@@ ed and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately banned drugs in the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods had brought about the airport security and how many would have intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that the people who are most often smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of items banned by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
fluids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to start with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ mined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales points , Tes@@ la chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure when announ@@ cing the latest quar@@ terly result : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders have already been withdrawn .
critics always pointed out that this is only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK £ 1,000 ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ aged , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not at the demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be merged - 500@@ ,000 , a million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
who orders a Model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines never tested in practice without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are major delays , the liability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s because of dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be re@@ active to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint , which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to respect the standards of 2015 for Oz@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay his observ@@ ance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection rules for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been persu@@ aded to block or delay regulating the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itment regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards would simply reinforce the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often not adher@@ ed to the deadlines for implementation and then waiting to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that eventually P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new constitution of the O@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a draft bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York @-@ General Prosecutor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had lam@@ ented the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit to health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil O@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and annually contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on their unexpected course changes .
&quot; it &apos;s wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsi@@ bles for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 16 : 30 pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius press is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ bl@@ gens their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer judgement : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen together with the Vog@@ tland &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the original document , on the hill of the Tum@@ bl@@ itz , apart from the former parish church , there was also a wonderful courtyard where the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged , not the other way round .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Freuden@@ stadt sky@@ scra@@ per from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ ling centre of the village .
old maps dating back to the year 1600 confirm these historical conditions .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied it with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was crushed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ nants of the church were threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hil@@ ary was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half sank .
in order to prevent disaster , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as success@@ ors by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn to the Hil@@ arius press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as promot@@ er , the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ el@@ gens invite to the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade .
this is made by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
celeb@@ r@@ ity Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the conclu@@ ding word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
to conclude the seren@@ ade , there is a drink in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers present the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius press , which is of great importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ ingen feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
Bo@@ is@@ heim does not assume any legal requirements for the construction and therefore has turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to accept his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are meant to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ fication &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days before , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided on a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier - but this did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning rights , the granted approval status is still illegal and therefore also withdraw , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city coun@@ cill@@ or once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been entered in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter again .
however , they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in regards to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning the construction of four wind@@ mills each 200 metres high on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is expected to be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashed : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car drove the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
city and merchants plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city center .
the commercial association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the city center shopping .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city provides away from the usual supermarket goods .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the action @-@ weekend , so Christian König .
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city center &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include new offerings , such as the first &quot; Active Tag &quot; to celebrate the well together with sal@@ ted Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to make them active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many natives would have lost the inner city while shopping out of the view .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the inner city - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .
it was an attempt to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly broad@@ ened itself , had told King in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that , for the first time , five Thurin@@ gian cities participate in the nationwide &quot; Heimat @-@ Shopp@@ en &quot; day .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Action conducted by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour as a direct environment .

Tru@@ mp deployed after guaranteed tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp called on a telephone with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president im@@ bu@@ ed him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to report , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and unveiled a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ massac@@ res : activists kidn@@ ap rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and contracted the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants flo@@ cked in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence , when a young black man was pulled by the passenger seat .
luckily this aw@@ ful scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post @-@ employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him the post @-@ employment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician lays down a sheet on the body of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ x on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one ever was accused .
although susp@@ ects have been on the open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to give their vote for the first time in the first election campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ole according to the F@@ BI of the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said rum@@ ors in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , according to the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey into prison .
but when they came from the prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and hiding the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more succ@@ inct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , that will happen to you here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is descri@@ p@@ tive , gri@@ pping and based in a sort of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to look , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I &apos;ve been going through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - came into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ concer@@ ted overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the head @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors performer Michael Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest scre@@ ams and push@@ es him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , he disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona answers the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time have said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona is saying the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a dream dress , stands above the corp@@ se of the actors and seduc@@ es Bil@@ lie &apos;s holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , arrived to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ des took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corp@@ ses .
children sit on their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw off the ly@@ n@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona is embra@@ cing two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and breaks down weeping in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner together with the actors .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta chat about the post @-@ appointment with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky therefore strug@@ gled to find words which had left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone is holding Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , eating and remembering the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in a way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ma@@ ged@@ don &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wagner admir@@ ers to Bay@@ reuth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf creates a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine le@@ vers pose as a rock ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels evoke Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ gold singers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
they dec@@ eive Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , sh@@ atter a corp@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight boxing .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus Eiche ) has to believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , humble and form@@ id@@ able by the hands of Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual casual wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; had he still had to leave a g@@ ell@@ tale pipe concert in 2013 , there were five years later great jubil@@ ation in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls were sub@@ du@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown an understanding of its point of view .
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work at several locations in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ term volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I have graduated from school .
and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I recognised for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is locally , at the focal point maybe , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system .
I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fachhochschule .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you make your FS@@ J .
you can make it from old people to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
for me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon @-@ care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really revol@@ ves .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
amount : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
there are always other people in the head , who each have a different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with them individually .
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also some negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and reduces the dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome pressure with which the company is faced .
the reduction of jobs , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , is in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May , in a third cost cutting programme , a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding to pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at Ber@@ tel@@ smann in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were viol@@ ated , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the suburbs of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening may have happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by an impro@@ vised cluster of people . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , of which about 20 % were in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide @-@ car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they were carrying out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack on the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 forced the Taliban out of power .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. president Donald Tru@@ mp wash@@ es up the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and , in particular , the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened one day after 15 states acc@@ li@@ mati@@ zed the agency due to the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Head Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in some part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured to specify where inc@@ isions have to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to rec@@ laim a broad range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups , which are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that breathing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants community space
at the end the decision was clear : in two opposite voices , the Municip@@ ality of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ner resol@@ ves to establish a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing part of the estate is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will continue until the church community has so far belonged to the community , there is now no prospect of planning for the project that is stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room for this purpose .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ vering to view such a common room as a meeting place only for the residents of the living room , but openly in the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided by funding opportunities in the past fall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common space would be that T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposal is to indicate to the investor that in this respect you don &apos;t want to throw a bil@@ lets between the legs , the statement that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as a pulse roof - which reduces the height of the roof and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela reputation points to the many own buildings with which one can &apos;t move so well , but now you lean on the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger strictly speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it provides a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to the already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but gets a real , in doubt a market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter@@ argument .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ man &apos;s request to apply the proposal accordingly finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the case with two counter@@ parts at the original program Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we handle the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycl@@ ist is thrown onto the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and badly injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was traveling with his bike on the bike path of the Black Way road from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction gave him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously did not regard the opposite traffic .
he pushed together with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a van .
Bayern München must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven pros are missing the defending champion in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the personnel managers at the German Football World Champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at the participating Pok@@ al Se@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to for@@ ego David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights will captiv@@ ate the fans .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , shared the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin from star to star
in the resin the first &quot; star path &quot; shall be created nationwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planning this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information many of the har@@ z@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and star pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question boxes St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ ei@@ ss and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards is to be complemented by the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star trail , the observers learn a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star sh@@ one more than another , although it was much further distant .
the con@@ stellation will also show in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association operates since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest situated astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often there are the Mil@@ ky Way from there and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye clearly visible .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star value Plan@@ etary Trail in the Uni @-@ City since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community tracks ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to at the end point degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 mil@@ lim@@ eter diameter while the exactly 75 meters away the sun is at least 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet is four kilometres .
while the light of sun is needed up to the Plu@@ to approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , going down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super Wei@@ ght Champion .
according to Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision about the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas commented that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for Bron@@ x &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to light @-@ weight trucks &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing takes this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to agree on a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after its light weight fight in the forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later squee@@ zed out openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday combat .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you didn &apos;t want to co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show impact , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighter , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Ver@@ los@@ ers to Ty@@ po@@ z
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost its control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market .
the passenger car sli@@ pped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he beat himself and stayed on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was closed towards the north for about one hour , then traffic could be passed by the accident site on the left lane .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann appears after 2 : 2 at the start of the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result too , there were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the Drei@@ erk@@ arte is also to be further optimised .
and a gate after a release does not want to capture the For@@ tun@@ ics any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be like no one else besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the Drei@@ erk@@ ette after the experience in preparation with the Drei@@ erk@@ ette .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the Drei@@ erk@@ ette on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t do so many mis@@ play mistakes in the building up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about an un@@ decided start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might have been a bit fres@@ her because they had no heavy and complete play like Fort@@ una against an ascension favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are an easy favourite on Sunday to meet at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat in advance , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as chief coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Auth@@ orities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Office ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees that were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are steady in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the person being investigated may be 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 , she realized that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it sure , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency advoc@@ ated the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton concrete part of the bridge was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Public Administration and Transport in the District of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three major bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges run over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons wei@@ ghted bridge cap on the north side .
this is an edge fixing which is also used as an operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to run .
the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ ek@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger tip feeling has required the laying of lines through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
this is because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in the run @-@ up to the work .
fish and cr@@ abs had to be f@@ ished initially .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a lane by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under Protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green Party , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) are part of a broad coalition that shows a peaceful flag this day , as Af@@ D invites to the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer civi@@ c centre R@@ ond@@ ell for the &quot; great election campaign &quot; according to the poster .
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land will form the winning duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D speakers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at one table &quot; on the fountain Square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that is there .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which the Af@@ D can eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported about the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel , he made an effort to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking places available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stadthalle various or@@ ators , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ bel , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch holding their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
for more than one hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can shift - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top @-@ class orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the well @-@ known Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach works with the two as in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this key piece of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and they will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that &apos;s cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the best @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was her &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague , Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately went bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with each one I had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten insi@@ sted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them she said , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I felt really offen@@ ded , scar@@ ed and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some consider me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee announced on Thursday evening a declaration stating : &quot; the change of the Party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country a great one . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is without leadership and is unable to find a positive , convincing message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ woman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hon@@ orable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as a clear excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that his country &apos;s exile was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were kno@@ cked away at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole council and the whole congress were delighted that the Russian Federation realised in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ inst@@ ate Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to normal@@ ise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the field of athle@@ tics world championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in London following a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mour@@ ning for Mali &apos;s crashed soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali were commemor@@ ated during a funeral service in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the still un@@ explained fall @-@ down case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old headquarters from Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the German army in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon only the relatives of the church took their leave .
then the funeral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ners laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense from the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the flight operation of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ acher , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali didn &apos;t show the Minister of Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country that we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought from the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any statements .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , it was said to be in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also dis@@ covers the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ mahl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function he wanted , he cannot see himself as equivalent to his wife - neither after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by explained , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
the final resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
the native @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
while his later wife always had the sympathy of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ins I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectual , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed of myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
because he spoke on Friday for the dissolution of the parliament .
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens MP from their Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its tight one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to be scheduled on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l believes it is essential that the Parliament resol@@ ves its self @-@ dissolution as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament is deprived of trust and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be legally checked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will calm@@ ly discuss all the questions if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country &apos;s mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally expect them to return their Land@@ tag mandate , which they received through the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president , Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner , shared with them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Party , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the S &amp; D Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition from Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attitude of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Socialists and Democrats Group on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the parliament .
the Australia Group &apos;s exit costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian stelle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her hurt vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has taken this dirty in@@ tra game and tries to beat political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) Spe@@ ech and Ans@@ wer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Federal Länder provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ ges .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched on and since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has as well as manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the back @-@ level content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded on eggs , these are not capable of transport .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants are not directly responsible .
on the contrary , they must reck@@ on on the basis of suspected illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there are too few controllers in the harvest .
is it just missing on the staff or in the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
precisely for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ utor in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular al@@ er@@ al@@ mus really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by means of the company , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are getting into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are clari@@ fied swiftly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , because the leading organization that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must eventually prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar is under@@ writing and bringing him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power of Qatar &apos;s rich family of sovereign@@ s .
clubs may invest a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter @-@ steer clear sources of revenue that allow them to reach the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year subscription period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini was dropped by the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to deter from excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the invoice over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenues for the next five years can be disclosed in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not allow this to be considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ing the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar &apos;s 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambassador is going to be and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to consider any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer , announ@@ cing Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish division was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the overall landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect financial fair@@ play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new company supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at has produced Fre@@ y Board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the order again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed chocolate boxes distributed to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss Life did not want to make any statements about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ver .
the Swiss will not want to disclose how many applicants will have it in the new bid .
in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y seeks to renew the agreement on spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the greatest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a statement .
Swiss have been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
prior to joining a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss made a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with a variety of Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the First Class customers are spoiled by the confection@@ ery of Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Lu@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class on the short track .

no@@ stal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
casting themselves on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play awesome children who will grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90@@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ evil plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random del@@ usion that could inc@@ ite this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the bands of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , is to be a bound TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic idi@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues will be synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was reproduced on a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have managed to blow the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office announced on Friday .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ensured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
two people were arrested for the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian investigations were involved .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been in charge of organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the C@@ ID Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the Grand Master was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the investigation focused mainly on Italian nation@@ als with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 at Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a tavern early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
sage gri@@ ps large gaps in the for@@ eig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e Management of the German Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the Aus@@ länder@@ behörde register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , warned in an analysis which exists in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are reported in the Register , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been properly maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or from citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data inputs can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included that would not have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false assur@@ ances did &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead to a distorted debate on dealing with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , the paper states that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF is introducing such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was pointing to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Convention , the EU state is responsible for refugees arriving at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant goes on to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country of travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states , too , would send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
the female spokes@@ woman in the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system , un@@ lawful admission conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who received awards on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his 100 donations , now shared 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation s@@ lau@@ ghters multiple prepar@@ edness to don@@ ate blood at the municipal council meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our bodies are created for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ators who make their blood available to strangers , not self @-@ serving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Kreis@@ atory Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn boo@@ ths reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K District Project Manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the Theatre has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ rel were one of the multiple founders and received 50 contributions each .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life @-@ juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month striving to increase because weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure would continue on budget revenues , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic package that was issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the finance plan to provide cheaper banks for banks from the coming February , although it has been said now that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened with consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts were revised down@@ wards for this and next year , compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound sli@@ pped after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth will probably be 0.3 % in the third quarter despite the recovery after the Bank towards the end of the year .
the most recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low salary increases , as the intensi@@ fication gets worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecasts will recover significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which is compensated by some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the pounds .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and it will resume in the coming months .
the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was to be attributed to the weak pound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the recent swa@@ p @-@ rate down@@ turn , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again as len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and finishing the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against financing the drug in the N@@ HS from September .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sexual pre@@ ex@@ positions proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the Health Service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK chef Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ operative proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local part of the medicine clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess pre@@ p &apos;s entire potential by collecting clinical evidence , as it is systematically used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , specifically targeted to vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , President of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shadow Minister of Health , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this study brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are HIV infected and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society one step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
life &apos;s great life : mezzanine and clever designer tips have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , decreased 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wished to add storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the problem .
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style of the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went in there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obj@@ ectively important so that when you push the door up , it slides very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can turn into something completely astonishing by a good design and increased square footage .
indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you might choose not to leave these .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a debate about one of the largest real estate agencies of Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a fierce debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - written by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the units proposed by Col@@ in left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 .
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed negotiations .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but throws Paul in managing some possessions in a competent manner .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the quar@@ rel .
&quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs increase in the case of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held on both sides .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million in leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ drew himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &apos; I can really not say much &apos; , because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e myself and draw up our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , adding that he still hopes for a solution . &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence to the president .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to keep the head on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House Chief of Staff , met with executive employees on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House that he wanted to fix : poor information coming into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship with television extends for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from places to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election couns@@ ellor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Twitter &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant pra@@ ising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more combus@@ tible material without their intervention .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his staff made it a few times to keep anger from him , their efforts paid off .
but nobody can consistently prevent Tru@@ mp &apos;s controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp materials that possibly promotes their views from the world .
Politi@@ co - dealing with this story - in May reported on the preference of advis@@ ers to indu@@ ce dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp is able to react to negative press cuts like a volcano , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on how they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone canc@@ els a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to har@@ ass@@ ment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he vo@@ iced fake alle@@ gations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
Tru@@ mp read the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold@@ makers added that former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the White House Secretary General Ro@@ b Por@@ ter tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tru@@ mp receives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police all over Europe will ship post@@ cards to dangerous criminals this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals are not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked for .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ ets hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed .
36 of the online singing could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to indications after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords in the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the war feet , which have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn up by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do street of Soli@@ hull which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ki@@ cked out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have driven the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , because he used to be useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back again .
more came last night , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding a long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just watched the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of the un@@ fu@@ elled camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling out 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we proceed with our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be opened again next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Bir@@ k@@ enhof hotel by the former Ambiente Company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenue generated by the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald , defended the hotel location and was already talking about serious prospects at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels , with its head office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building waste containers in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ stil .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is remo@@ del@@ ed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nicely bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher downtown level , emphasizes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wanted to spread broad@@ ly , explained Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people will feel comfortable in the hotel .
he already had talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define himself closely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior installations are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is open to the public , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Off@@ er sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , Special Off@@ ers Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury upon a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel has taken up work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on people familiar with the cause . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper regarded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified his investigation .
the broad@@ caster CN@@ N reported that there was already the Gre@@ mi@@ um &apos;s first role in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been bl@@ aming the Krem@@ lin for a long time to deliberately interfer@@ ed with the 2016 presidential election .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men acting as advis@@ ors to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Off@@ ers Tru@@ mp have personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in potential cases of crime and decide whether to be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called wag@@ ons .
most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the process is always done behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office to invite persons to take part under oath .
according to CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were called upon to testify , it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his female election boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were there .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the translation shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the collection of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feeling good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he knew nothing of the sub@@ stitution of a Grand Jury .
this work , however , usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures which ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it won &apos;t be determined against the president .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed in that way , it was stated in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after he had fired up Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this gul@@ f accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become lou@@ dly , he refused to obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president is under great pressure because of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Off@@ er and its employees .
this spark@@ ed speculation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the president of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented the bill on Thursday after which the special issu@@ er could no longer be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened itself from the ice shelf .
this communicated the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing over one tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it has mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that have registered researchers over the past three decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no danger to people from him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear after research findings .
in total , however , for some 30 years , there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers this can be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt several years ago disturbed .
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete sh@@ mal@@ ade .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ She@@ ep Ice Shel@@ f is in danger , as the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it emerges after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly raise sea level , but only to a small extent , is the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is the fourth @-@ largest shelf of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists it was disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ tag would grow back or fall back long @-@ term and possibly collap@@ ses , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , over the past few decades , there have been a lot of e@@ as@@ iness zones in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
this long skir@@ t of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
over the past 50 years the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up by around three degrees and thus ranks among the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f to staff
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employer &apos;s association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Day has perme@@ ated 41 new places in administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now again 17 trainees have completed their first day of work .
the teachers in the circle are obviously highly cov@@ eted .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
however , the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to join the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG jointly with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demands on skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a ver@@ itable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contest of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this results in a high number of employees leaving the service for disease or age .
high time for action so that there are not even more places left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
already in the circle of the circle he caused a big surprise when he publicly question the personnel expenses and was astonished by the rest of the parties .
people want to check all possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the communal employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county administration with the trade unions - maybe in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should aim for a ho@@ ist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money exist only if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the tone on NGO migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , that they may not continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their crew had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that its crew adop@@ ts din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one of these meetings allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta need to have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and rescue operations , have previously agreed to abide by the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable given that they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Co@@ ast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and Si@@ ghts for four days .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always leng@@ thier asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the lookout was at the lookout , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and ruins made welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ e cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .

after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group met the forest of Pal@@ at@@ inate from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga car@@ ves for e @-@ sport
in the future , the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , rather than shooting through the stadium during wind and weather conditions ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have also recognized the first Bundes@@ liga which is increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg in 2015 , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that several clubs are going up on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract one could be present online much more often on these markets than once a year to send the Federal Ar@@ bit@@ ration to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup are being challenged at competitive level .
long ago , as in normal sport , le@@ agues were established in which the pros compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games , E @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it all about a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is surely getting used to getting used to .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atic has dealt with the question for a long time .
for Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that one can find in the classic sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise and respect the nutrition not only on the console , but also their body .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to carry out when playing online , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the highly integr@@ ative impact of e @-@ sport in a positive way .
the players are internationally on the road , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the Consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
turnover is expected to be 130 million in three years .
this is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte couns@@ ell@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the international level .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ stein@@ Off@@ erer Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport division .
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in the European comparison , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
just falling into no@@ stal@@ gia and clearing the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; D@@ utt also means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that everything remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter for the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy pressing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even her mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor reading a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain , which we will wear for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by some press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder to her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment at the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
FC Bayern ad@@ mits a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - there is no chance of extra motivation .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ bie immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ante and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was also able to interpret the sign from the coach .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f existing from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday .
sugar is preferably distributed to those with a lot of trust that you want to keep in a good mood .
those who were chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ahm , can use a little extra motivation only well .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old scored a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
to the right back , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and Kim@@ i was at all active in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ installed tro@@ op .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal thus to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fold hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ chs with it , on the devil , come out of the services of the Asia trip ( fold also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le so , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t , do not fall neg@@ atively .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran along beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign .
the nam@@ ically occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times successfully in the game build @-@ up .
his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mits that the result &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in their debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also caught for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavarian @-@ world still is for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i left after a couple of cr@@ un@@ chy statements on the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller announced shortly before the game about Twitter and the Ö@@ F@@ B que@@ ens liked all the best .
the Bavarian @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary is a club @-@ colleague from Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ ell beck and with our La@@ dies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian soccer player of the year and champi@@ ons League winners should be a special motivation .
the famous Bavaria @-@ Dus@@ el could possibly also take good care of our ladies .
company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy praise d@@ ress@@ ings Tempo
it often became irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk to T V enquiry about a change in economic policy - while at the same time the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the major turning @-@ around looks natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the Ministry hopes to set up a plan for planning , until 2021 is supposed to be the right of construction .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Marketing Plan .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
as suggested by Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) aims to increase sales in supermarkets in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports declining for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company lo@@ gically praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says CEO Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a bonus of 1000 Euro is planned for the master test and 2500 euros if graduates decide to become independent within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road construction , there are quick facts to be created , at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
only 29 dig@@ its have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ bis@@ sing in the state of mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce requested more orders to be awarded to external offices .
s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 , less than suggested by country roads .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies rated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the rating of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind turbine producer Pro Wind .
the Green faction left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe - where after four months she cleared the field again because of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW CEO said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than travel restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he referred to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the costs for the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising diesel @-@ powered exhaust gases also increase , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of viol@@ ating the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but drive back under normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested by Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi into the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
if it goes on to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction department wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a big information resource saver .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to shar@@ pen our understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft sailed across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ itt@@ ens and the laugh of suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely published carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still working and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he worked as a carto@@ onist for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by towns .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits on the drawing table , working daily for nearly ten hours .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ l@@ ly figures continue to find spreading worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand @-@ feet as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will be projected onto the movie screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ally .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is falling down because of the conditions reminiscent of dro@@ ught and due to diseases transmitted diseases , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the ag@@ ro @-@ research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which in the spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium which transfers the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long vegetable clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 anniversary .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
merchants , guil@@ ds , merchants , vag@@ ants or a country camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no silence of violence , and while the corp@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live and become a journalist in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was set up in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ete and even though the terrain is even more tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little value , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we are mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter ran away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez had been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
initially there was in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti@@ trust fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake lay in not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for North America in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ hitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in prosec@@ uting Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pu@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task you as a journalist does - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and always sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing arguments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust your own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells mis@@ er@@ ably , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the publisher of Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no cell@@ phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers who were not trust@@ worthy by the governor himself .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has made three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former renowned Bo@@ xer Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to government spending that focused on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost the entire century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been turned into a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected themselves : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few notes and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; in organized protests and buildings .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a a day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of scor@@ ing journalists and leaving them because they told the truth .
she has since then asked her to be re @-@ classified by the government , because she is concerned that her anger viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his latest book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were involved in organised crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media group last year assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said .
obviously the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that was said to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the D@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .

&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to be sum@@ mon@@ ed .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt nos@@ eb@@ and and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bath resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b@@ ber &apos;s edge they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ten nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the violent portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the practitioner asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a terri@@ fying one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ ation of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ r cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved condition is ast@@ o@@ unding researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he gru@@ b at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21st , 2011 .
he met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal inside the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth l@@ ump@@ y .
after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family first made head@@ lines in May and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and shape of sheds and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven from enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter@@ sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors of the chal@@ k @-@ time must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows also that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for reference to his life , including his con@@ served account , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven into the sea , where he sank to the bottom of the sea .
at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved skin but also retained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early part of the circle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs crossed the earth .
although the King of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons wei@@ ghty monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the trade journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he gru@@ b in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average around 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were sw@@ elled by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house residues still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the Lotto .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates bearing the skull of the animal .
its right foref@@ oot rests on its side , its five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in the storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
a heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age in the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first indications of the police were between the connecting stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm under 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , inter@@ tw@@ ined .
there are no indications of the exact number of injured persons .
it was a question of slight to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a 10 @-@ kilometre long back@@ stage was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , there was also on the on@@ ward road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted down the number plates of the vehicle drivers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing clu@@ es , one sits on the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ening into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ af@@ e or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by a mobile phone that you take your seat and thus de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the card de@@ valuation without any conductor .
in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers already do anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one goes on the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
the test customer then appears a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at room Y ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without any ticket inspection by our train crew will simply check themselves in the DB Navigator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to customize their travel time by train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marketing Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often go by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest occasions .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travellers not all the documents that you need to vali@@ date online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , leading to a bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the conductor in the end to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further gn@@ aw@@ s on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eter the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ et about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people crying , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... killing all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l reminded him of her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance stem@@ ming from the people &apos;s point of view , who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a fitting crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; black experience &quot; and &quot; black state &quot; countless times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation by officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take place for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has completely changed after August 9 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came into mind Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years following Brown &apos;s shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are portrayed , for so I will be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is uph@@ eld by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person that sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not by chance , even though it was on the front lines , because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman stands so much in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the telecommunications cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV reader discussing about Bit @-@ Galerie
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its people into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves a cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real clas@@ sy &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while advoc@@ ates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ eds .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property in which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct markets offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility to sit outside .
Simone &apos;s rooms : &quot; we have been buying in the farmers market for almost a week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes made by the women of the country very gladly again and again .
also the but@@ cher shop we discovered for us .
we would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery sett@@ les , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this should probably not be too low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is your favorite shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dr@@ ink@@ - or supermarkets , I think that is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top .
as you can see , store stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not wear@@ able for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit in Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmer &apos;s market hall planned during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost@@ ly bit gallery already manage to exp@@ el all the business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping centre empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall there is no more room thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after making publicly classified diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman , and landmark , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted for 20 charges in 2013 , including six off@@ ences against the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this paper , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette smu@@ dge and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal to Bri@@ anne &apos;s friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o who fores@@ aw a future in which the president would convert Chelsea judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome sort of happy coincidence .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and heavy as Donald Tru@@ mp runs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid cle@@ av@@ age that he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her family name ) has been an end to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people hope to take with it is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic book .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges from the disciplinary coats of arms of the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they deliver your speech , they won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep your mouth shut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when it was supposed to do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from its own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University sought to kill
a nationwide shooting is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder , due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Local Court show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a joint warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the scene , and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ensis , the Vice @-@ President of University Relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them had now been in custody and had been excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ensis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the testimony added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be surprised .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities will help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM ann@@ ot@@ ated the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ setting R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list indicates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mut@@ ation said in relation to the matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one wants to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was expelled from WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
we shared this with the company groups .

as of now , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ete Anti @-@ L@@ utter solvents .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - che@@ ating .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t MEP , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it called people from the outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and address directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive Officer of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap @-@ p@@ olls and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low appro@@ vals - so you can re @-@ drill why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility at a glance .
the global governance , regulation , and compliance industries could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial @-@ technical Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
recently , u@@ ber has registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent Business makes customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys to send confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the discomfort of employees .
now that the company deplo@@ ys Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that previously had been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair placement - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of employment experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ tering secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors can achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have gone too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day , if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after the gathering of feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company will always get new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
it &apos;s about 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers chat@@ ted on one side of the team &apos;s new practice fields .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot pieces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Aqu@@ arian Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a real treadmill for the boys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and they actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three U@@ C@@ LA trainings should start at 19 : 15 to meet the pre @-@ packed schedule of the players .
the compromise goes away from the two days is more than a day at which the fry moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons passed in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to do 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the change in regulation of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continued to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is completed , given the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a luxury hotel that has already been ki@@ cked with foot@@ balls that will be a protective grid behind a door@@ post , no easy task .
break players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then stop there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and show their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to facts inspec@@ tors that may display results of the fact audit from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fak@@ ten@@ eber@@ gers are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is working on other changes to its news feed to l@@ essen false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic book : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat at the Ver@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opolitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Tra@@ ie@@ wicz , British May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library , a project he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &quot; s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself were there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this is all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &apos; new &apos; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with fellow country@@ men , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was granted full access until 2006 when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years &quot; in which ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who had what : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go his way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il which appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons which the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l depic@@ ts his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his mission in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about E@@ lä@@ kel@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle v@@ eils in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveiled of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a festival on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the campaign have been asking for the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their un@@ folded web page on their yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnef &apos;s citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they compete with other communities .
the city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five @-@ digit figure for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
the meeting was also attended by the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
so the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the head@@ count .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
general Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar is in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a leader of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been acting in Ankara since that week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan declared the attempt to overthrow the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ veiled in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for female soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the army and the security forces continue .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan decre@@ ed another 7@@ 3@@ 95 ministers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan has t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to g@@ lean sooner than the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the mund@@ ane state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan stri@@ pped the power of the military step by step , not least by relying on the reform targets of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is pushing for a targeted Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an especially non @-@ known officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt from persecution in foreign countries refused to be the Turkish army in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , in the Alliance , there are doubts about the prepar@@ edness of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he fores@@ ees lower legal migrants at 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on visa facil@@ itation and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law shall be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the US will be issuing the way citizens from other countries will be issued green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate route for race @-@ platform shuttle
over the past few months over the past few months we have been argu@@ ing about the future of the pav@@ ement - now it is going to be very fast .
even before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built at the same distance on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work will be commen@@ ced later this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to continue to order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important connection , &quot; explained the State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of the course was about 2.5 million euros .
of that sum , the country sur@@ passes 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alized , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle was to be ordered as a regular order on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , it has been tested as part of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly again in the future .
the track is also strongly b@@ auf@@ eled in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just when you thought that it won &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said at the publication of his new report .
modern exp@@ and@@ aries have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his convi@@ ctions and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who would make a step@@ pe @-@ woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sc@@ exp@@ els have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Comp@@ ani@@ on with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the site of True Comp@@ ani@@ on .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she has her m@@ oods in the course of the day - just like real people !
she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ rement on ra@@ pes , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , fre@@ eing one most .
on its website true Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy uses a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
its emergence and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R sees their growing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumption culture .
but what transp@@ ires from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened in which there is a president in the White House who urged women to be sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most sc@@ ary aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn out body and the st@@ amped eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ ages , &quot; the robots do not represent real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ary or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the formula of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney an ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp .
we are all supposed to let our filtering ble@@ es burst .
less noticed is the power of tru@@ mp to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ facing po@@ urer who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she strug@@ gled for decades for politics , is suddenly and very especi@@ al on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it seems to me that this also involves considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer rep@@ el us one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Repub@@ lic@@ ans , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of ration@@ ality in comparison with its standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself obs@@ essed with an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return failed ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp are indeed a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sels , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ pen@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a stran@@ gely magical experience since two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given it the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ usable gr@@ ins@@ ing while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he re@@ port@@ edly suffered from prison authorities in one case in his cell .
due to murder following an appeal by prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first slaughter .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet in his home in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , of which they say that it was too indul@@ gent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Law En@@ forcement Administration said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold found a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ cli@@ ppers from F@@ ers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released in the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students went to the secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle , who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lively band performed a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and had it hat@@ ched from his chickens .
instead of a chicken swe@@ ater , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle bom@@ bed his wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carried to the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ na@@ ve that he feels accepted in his new school .
thanks to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps at instruc@@ tional bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the time of the cu@@ cum@@ bers is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher stated .
she left her students very reluct@@ ant after two years of teaching , because it had been a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door @-@ kids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , all students let out a song of summer time and holiday time .
great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ children are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .
on the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegal refugees in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve emission performance of Euro 5 emissions and Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates tra@@ ded are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compulsory updates are only valid for vehicles that have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schumann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Office of Cars ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but they have not yet called a precise date .
Daimler advised to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within the framework .
how long should the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the involvement of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the subject of environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
will a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now thre@@ aten ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE recommends to wait for sale .
ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award

the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US president Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series , therefore already announced to refrain from attending the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tru@@ mp to make her point of view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after the former President , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the earlier prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will be in R@@ ente next year .
the job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
since 31 years , W@@ acker has been a City Engineer .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he is im@@ par@@ ting in the press talk .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers .
at the same time , it wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach is acting as a sub @-@ contractor for the Board of Directors , the applicant must show relevant statements .
this function is intended to keep the city in any case .
if it could no longer be fulfilled , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but citizens &apos; proximity is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports of a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , a number of significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the building office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are many varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz have been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium refurb@@ ishment is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will hit with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all there are great tasks waiting for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; design &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available for a master builder of great manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gardening , much can be re@@ acted flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what it fits , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city super@@ visor stresses .
the city super@@ visor already bears great responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the end everything runs above my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on long @-@ term employees for care and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Scho@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
who would like to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should have a degree in studying architecture after the town of Has@@ lach and have a Bachelor &apos;s degree with the subject of architecture and have good expertise in the areas of structural and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) are building construction and civil engineering , building control planning , building instruction , administration of urban properties , municipal farm with building yard and garden landscap@@ ing , as well as underground civil and monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : closed on the south
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway tracks in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night @-@ hours .
near the crime scene , a rose driver and a bike driver were watched by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ sty realm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed themselves and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the equipment , as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail damages , P@@ ön@@ alen can also be sent to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum should be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without obstruc@@ tions .
just under ten passenger trains were dropped Friday morning , two of them watched the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains were not conspic@@ uous , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cr@@ amps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the patient is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ e encourages more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also affects humans .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was accommodated separately , had not had this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in the mice .
mice were wound up in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same intoler@@ ance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season match before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho announced that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing hat painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. State Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had earlier made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new kick @-@ off for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fri@@ lls from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Bund , was the most important desire of the elec@@ torate .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , the fundamental change has changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with a growing horror .
what Mr Schulz from there since the beginning of the year would have been described with a head@@ wind not even in the approach .
there were failures .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start@@ ling faction of a Gre@@ ens MP has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apo@@ state Lower Saxony Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and Ele@@ ction Leader of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD electoral fighter si@@ gh@@ tens when the new ob@@ scene message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority after the green dep@@ uties of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests .
it is the preliminary high point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere continued with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , not more , the comrades reas@@ sured at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was the case too - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to reel , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te led the party smoothly .
the comrades te@@ dious themselves in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep @-@ beat .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ shut @-@ head , lost his nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in crisis communication he was doing so pretty much everything that could be done wrong .
since then Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust @-@ gas and its role on the board of directors , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now .
historical survey values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe because of that , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks .
the endeav@@ our of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ concealed , too , in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal force of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed at the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ westen represents her own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party links in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person but by the national list of the Gre@@ ens of Lower Saxony , so the Lower Saxon Parliament continues .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &quot; vote four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U MP fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further assur@@ ances of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local politicians III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development informed on Wednesday in sensi@@ tivities .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened to date .
since 1991 , there have been rehabilitation areas in sen@@ sing areas .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg still took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 , subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - in the end it is important to promote internal development and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a restructuring area III .
the funding amount amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros are coming from the country , the rest from the municipality .
how is a renovation area now emerging ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the area boundaries could then be postpon@@ ed again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is , per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a by@@ ci@@ ary .
the period of approval for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the stock@@ taking would only be carried out , within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation area received a questionnaire .
in November or December , the order intake should be carried out as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can start in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preventive examinations .
the aim is to evaluate the urban@@ istic mis@@ understand@@ ings and decide when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
a remedi@@ ation notice in the land register is also recorded for the respective property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come home again and get a picture of the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the participation of the participants was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , questionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Land Sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it works among other things about the structural condition and the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , division and residents of a residential space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be ref@@ illed if premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works - whoever comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip in order to get in house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one now has both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights U.S. manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military provided to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence , and senior civil servant of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the Connec@@ ti@@ cut helicopter was placed next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his super@@ visor , the Deputy Minister of Nav@@ al Aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for return flight .
the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event , while the unit &apos;s safety personnel remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the recordings provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear that ultimately a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act provides federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to claim their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Spo@@ kes@@ person secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 held 58 courses in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ per units flew an additional 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden on none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the pres@@ idency flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
unit records list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost for the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for the reimbur@@ sement rate is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement sets do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and cul@@ min@@ ated with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss about tricky task
pioneer of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga ki@@ cks off at the Tab@@ ellen@@ ic Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ellen@@ ic Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V tomorrow .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the top rider of the second tennis league Bundes@@ liga was able to make sense for the reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North are above all .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ova ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ sey ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser squ@@ ad for the trip to the high north stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Challen@@ ger Tournam@@ ent at the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not succeed in the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will play at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first use this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white @-@ Russian An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the Ball .
he should also be present in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories over the last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move back into the team .
if the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , did not fill the cad@@ re from the Train@@ erst@@ end@@ um Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on Wednesday evening to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that will help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , since then investors of the O@@ MV , which together with other European firms have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership Nord Stream 2 .
the threat of dro@@ u@@ ghts is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved to the center in the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer unveiled , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) is the Mexican association , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
role reverse : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban children &apos;s care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed goods .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children receive a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last year of the year 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are cared for 45 hours of the week , are in the K@@ ita at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff from 1st September kitchen service : they heat up the supplied food , supplement them to salad , raw vegetables and fruits , divide the meal individually , give food out , clean off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides over the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the c@@ ital@@ isation to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about eating healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical one , says it from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people in education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ son , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates in the Council elections in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ on said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan independent Ele@@ ction Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of registered 3.6 million voters .

men trying to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to police information , the men were the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 14.@@ 55 P.@@ M. , because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but continued with her friends .
then one of the offen@@ ders tried to grab the mobile phone and necklace of the girl , which , however , failed .
without prey the duo fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant by managers of bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds over the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the branch leader of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vo@@ icing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB senior organizer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce has a strong focus on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow is desper@@ ately needed for a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we appreciate ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies working in a highly competitive and uns@@ af@@ e economic climate , constantly review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross facility , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned about N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La league may show her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after issuing an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about how N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G President three years ago before this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign up , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish society expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter up@@ side down and damaged
in the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders intentionally turned off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the estate number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle damage of more than 200 Euro .

the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
as a car met him in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade and tou@@ red the road@@ side .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was driving with his VW at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ bach in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him on his lane so that he had to turn right .

the driver of the approaching passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the cycl@@ one had not noticed the accident .

&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope John Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the ab@@ uses is reli@@ eved by Pope John Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared an excuse from the former Regensburg Bishop and the present car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral cap@@ tor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false estim@@ ation of the events .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the measure of &quot; double standards &quot; when reporting on violence at the dom@@ es .
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is about &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ l@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ ed@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and that &apos;s a fixed fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows were a quite normal ped@@ ago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with happy children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope John Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often also appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann refers to the reminder book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became victims of over@@ took between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; 67 dom@@ ed cats sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , said : &quot; in summary , it can be said that von Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims were estimated to have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre@@ mis@@ es of Non @-@ Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ises at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives an conflic@@ ting image of master builder Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as chol@@ eli@@ tist and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became tangible when a dome set brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found in it at all .
there are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside of his sphere of influence .
one can at best repro@@ ach him of having experienced it too late or not having taken first indications seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was perceived as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the vast majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger exhibits an excellent testim@@ onial , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and was &quot; always surrounded by grapes from children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to flood break@@ through@@ s .
he was deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the fact that he did not only mun@@ ch with chairs and cast the key@@ hole on the floor , but also scrat@@ ched ear fi@@ gs and pulled too happy guys on the hair or ears , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you also know such cultivation methods ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state secondary school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are of course Bag@@ at@@ ella .
you wonder if it is not more likely to do with his fame and role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media had just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , there was a lot of information on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger include any involvement or co @-@ knowing in terms of sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not a single of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have trusted the master of the cathedral .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in clari@@ fying sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they didn &apos;t trust even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger judge R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the abuse cases ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected to have opened up to it ... Bu@@ ben inv@@ inci@@ ble or clearer or even more open than their parents , boarding departments , trust teachers etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up to affected students and / or their surroundings , the investigation could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he cannot be accused of having not prevented him or brought him to the show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to link up his good name with these vile crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former mayor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was thrown in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ visor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the primary school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful testing ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were really har@@ assed and mal@@ adjusted and suffered terri@@ bly , all of them took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there really had to be sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the hospital gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the theme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secondary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , at the most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the hospital gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the primary school , the testing penalty is still practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when testing fin@@ es were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us still knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate the situation where the affected persons might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that just isn &apos;t right .
only in 1980 the test sentence in schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; historians are talking about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating past and present moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and not for what has been bre@@ ached in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond the practice at that time .
this is all aw@@ ful and I am happy that it will finally work up .
but at the same time I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipline and punishment , that is to say ear fi@@ gs and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his Regensburg time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the subject matter of check @-@ in also come to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
nevertheless , I did not mention that he led a tight regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without claiming absolute discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and sweets on their own , people from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys now do not make a big singer and stand before every success , whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep faith and heart @-@ good people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do anything just a fly .
I regularly receive with how many former dom@@ es still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , regularly maintain contact with him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are therefore un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally in the minority .
most of the dom@@ es are grateful to him today for enri@@ ching their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father @-@ like teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lovely respect person , to which they still look and worship them .
and please , once more clearly , all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , all too apparent .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the attack would stop , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany &apos;s probably nobody knew the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
