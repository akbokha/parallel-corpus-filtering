<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An asylum-institution where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small growers manage the erstwhile ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich favours exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows this, who had to get upset already, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but actual - but very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and churches in the area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork carpet, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called prototype sheets, were incorporated into the large map of the map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bayerische Staatsgemungsverwaltung from 1810 to 1864, these were created and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, the French army chief occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally withdrew from Lunéville on February 9th, 1801, they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian survey administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The data sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bayerische Landesbibliothek).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / present is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is the sub-sendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as a district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the city is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-scale card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flatlands from the so-called "Uranium" from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots of land today do not occupy any farmers anymore - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of the sub-sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete scaffolding in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the present-day district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street names "at the guest house" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt" in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district-madhouse" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created there." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and, for example, ended the so-called Irish anchor." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also forbids the personnel to use force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was initially room, later on 500 places were extended.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gyroscope in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet now on the premises of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football field of TSV Munich East is located west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - in an architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenitanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main place" "" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman publishes travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Farming has issued a warning to colourful people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Council for the State of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of dubious, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and noted here," says the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted version of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the government's prosecution authorities that disproportionately aim at minorities, prompted the group to publish the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents like racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during his journey through the state and was put into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Bureau of Missouri's General Prosecutor, shown that black motorists are detained in the state 75 percent more often than white people.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be prepared to bring money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hassan Crimes Report, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration, which will contribute to the ACLU's view of further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher pasture-fence-project is a success-project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary representatives Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac obtained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the justice-grabbing of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-branch meet together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses the holiday homes in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest Milk" "" "is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste comes exclusively Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" "" "elementary important" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitable on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, a lot of things have to be edited with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead to organic farming.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader's promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the area could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The exhibition area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half was promoted via leader, a quarter contributed the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it's not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss also stated:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-of-the-art state-of-the-art state-of-the-art state-of-the-art Baden-Württemberg offers state-of-the-art production of wheat fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a speculator referred to by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the adjacent surface must not be smuggled (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "for the" "" "Fisherman's" "" "electric fence project 2018, there is currently an application for eight participants with 24 plots that would like to build a fence of just under 16 kilometres." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">The exhibition area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciated these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not grasp the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty immeasurers would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he assumed their importance, and in particular the importance of which it was attributed, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta proceeded, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem that you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your idleness, your poor, your afflicted masses who crave to breathe freely, / the miserable garbage of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not get involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural engagement: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that she had completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism, presenting in a worn-out classical representation portraying the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusually, Limbaugh came across something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elearning but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue tells them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the path, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">The Director of Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butler- who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, competing at the 400-m hurdles in their fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The short-distance runner Muir runs along this road and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which you should watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain commented that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but also in some cases also be involved in the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the electing of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the papers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He leaped with criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this fact at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sercherin Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing in the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his mail and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>

<seg id="421">Electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to start with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far undermined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales points, Tesla chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed a different, less glamorous figure when announcing the latest quarterly result: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk has frequently recruited more than 500,000 orders for the new car, whose extradition is just beginning.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63,000 of the total of 518,000 orders have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics always pointed out that this is only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of a cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK £1,000) "Reservation Payments."</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 of such non-binding reservations envisaged, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not at the demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be merged - 500,000, a million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who orders a Model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines never tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery site in Tumlingen was invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 16: 30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius press is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and promoters Tumblgens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasizes:" "" "it is a unique village treasure." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer judgement: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen together with the Vogtland "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the original document, on the hill of the Tumblitz, apart from the former parish church, there was also a wonderful courtyard where the church or the patronage belonged, not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Freudenstadt skyscraper from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settling centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to the year 1600 confirm these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied it with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was crushed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church were threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hilary was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half sank.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent disaster, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>

<seg id="504">Association wants to allow approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">Boisheim does not assume any legal requirements for the construction and therefore has turned to the Councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim refuses" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to accept his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones are meant to prevent" "" "parasification" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days before, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier - but this did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a fault.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning the construction of four windmills each 200 metres high on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is expected to be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="682">They work at several locations in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in the open full day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-term volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I have graduated from school.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I recognised for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is locally, at the focal point maybe, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Quantity: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">In the winter semester, I will start my studies in the social system.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably in the Jugendamt Herne a social worker training and studying in Hamm at the Fachhochschule.</seg>

<seg id="702">It always depends on where you make your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">You can make it from old people to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">For me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon-care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really revolves.</seg>
<seg id="708">Unlike in civil engineering studies?</seg>
<seg id="709">Amount: well, here it's not about calculating statics.</seg>
<seg id="710">There are always other people in the head, who each have a different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a teenager, has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with them individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And they had no reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Quantity: for this I am not the type.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome pressure with which the company is faced.</seg>
<seg id="720">The reduction of jobs, which General Director John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">Pearson announced in May, in a third cost cutting programme, a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="730">The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital on Bagram's airfield.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilian casualties, of which about 20% were in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July, a suicide-car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they were carrying out this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack on the country since the US-led troops in 2001 forced the Taliban out of power.</seg>

<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it works great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, foreman at the Department of Public Administration and Transport in the District of Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work began at the same time on all three major bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is planned for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges run over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning got a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge cap on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge fixing which is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dieko.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular finger tip feeling has required the laying of lines through the structure in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">This is because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in the run-up to the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crabs had to be fished initially.</seg>

<seg id="932">It is not so common that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties (CDU, SPD, Green Party, FDP, FWG, left) are part of a broad coalition that shows a peaceful flag this day, as AfD invites to the Gerolsteiner civic centre Rondell for the "great election campaign" according to the poster.</seg>

<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weibel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch holding their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">For more than one hour the AfD event takes place, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 21 o'clock.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed expenditures of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organization that supervises the European game has the power to forbid teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG must eventually prove that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose, so that Neymar is underwriting and bringing him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power of Qatar's rich family of sovereigns.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may invest a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to counter-steer clear sources of revenue that allow them to reach the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">"" "" "" "FFP was designed by Michel Platini for his election to the UEFA President in 2007." ""</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively deceive and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year subscription period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini was dropped by the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to deter from excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the invoice over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the revenues for the next five years can be disclosed in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most serious sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar's 2022 have denied that Neymar WM ambassador is going to be and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to consider any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, announcing Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish division was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going to see, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Life's great life: mezzanine and clever designer tips have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wished to add storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went in there," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is objectively important so that when you push the door up, it slides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can turn into something completely astonishing by a good design and increased square footage.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Indeed, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave these.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a debate about one of the largest real estate agencies of Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a fierce debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her late father Colin - written by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the units proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul in managing some possessions in a competent manner.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the quarrel.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansshop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, with Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million in leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "Paul says" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withdrew himself very much, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS, to say 'I can really not say much', because the case is in front of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue myself and draw up our family name through the courts," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he still hopes for a solution. "</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abstinence to the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the head on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff, met with executive employees on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to fix: poor information coming into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television extends for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from places to convince," "" "said the former election counsellor Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Twitter's Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praising." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more combustible material without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff made it a few times to keep anger from him, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody can consistently prevent Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - dealing with this story - in May reported on the preference of advisers to induce doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he insists on how they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone cancels a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he voiced fake allegations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "goldmakers added that former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary General Rob Porter tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The Koloss, weighing over one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers, is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that have registered researchers over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">"" "" "" "there is no danger to people from him." ""</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear after research findings.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, for some 30 years, there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeira floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfe is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelseshoe was the balance of waxes and abrupt several years ago disturbed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete shmalade.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Sheep Ice Shelf is in danger, as the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeira and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it emerges after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly raise sea level, but only to a small extent, is the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C Schelfeira is the fourth-largest shelf of Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scientists it was disputed whether the Larsen-C Scheltag would grow back or fall back long-term and possibly collapses, "said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, over the past few decades, there have been a lot of easiness zones in the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the past 50 years the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by around three degrees and thus ranks among the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif to staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU asks to step out of the employer's association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the Cretaceous Day has permeated 41 new places in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now again 17 trainees have completed their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are obviously highly coveted.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to join the FDP and the UWG jointly with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demands on skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a veritable" "" "contest of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This results in a high number of employees leaving the service for disease or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">High time for action so that there are not even more places left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Already in the circle of the circle he caused a big surprise when he publicly question the personnel expenses and was astonished by the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want to check all possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the communal employer association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we don't come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the county administration with the trade unions - maybe in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aim for a hoist," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, elevations or more money exist only if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up, in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least, by the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy aggravates the tone on NGO migrants "lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, that they may not continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "" "said Home Secretary, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their crew had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor's Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew adopts dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied to them directly by traffickers, and that smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one of these meetings allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa need to have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs, who are involved in search and rescue operations, have previously agreed to abide by the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable given that they would not bring any" "" "significant changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "by now, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy Trials and Sights for four days.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always lengthier ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1613">In the future, the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, rather than shooting through the stadium during wind and weather conditions?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">"" "" "" "we have also recognized the first Bundesliga which is increasingly involved in this field." ""</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning was the VfL Wolfsburg in 2015, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football must be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-sportsmen under contract one could be present online much more often on these markets than once a year to send the Federal Arbitration to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games such as "League of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA World Cup are being challenged at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sport, leagues were established in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games, E-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is surely getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobatic has dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that one can find in the classic sport - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise and respect the nutrition not only on the console, but also their body.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but also problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to carry out when playing online, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the highly integrative impact of e-sport in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are internationally on the road, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the Consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Turnover is expected to be 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"" "however, the e-sport" "" "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," "" "the Deloitte counsellors write." ""</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The costs for the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralising diesel-powered exhaust gases also increase, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of violating the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he worked as a cartoonist for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by towns.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is falling down because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transmitted diseases, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agro-research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which in the spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a micro-bacterium which transfers the dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather, there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"" "Eric Chaisse said:" "" "instead of having very long vegetable clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened." ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no silence of violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer by Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live and become a journalist in Mexico," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Public Prosecutor's Office was set up in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolete and even though the terrain is even more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little value, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we are mistrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter ran away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez had been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Initially there was in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the sons, suspected aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake lay in not forcing Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for North America in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "Bojorquez said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in prosecuting Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompuviento TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curb like a dockworker, a friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best and stay alive.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust your own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells miserably, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing is happening with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers who were not trustworthy by the governor himself.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has made three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former renowned Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to government spending that focused on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost the entire century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few notes and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa a day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of scoring journalists and leaving them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked her to be re-classified by the government, because she is concerned that her anger violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a indifferent society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his latest book "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were involved in organised crime under a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he grub at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21st, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossils discovered by him were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to expose the wild animal inside the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth lumpy.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, say experts suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family first made headlines in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and shape of sheds and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was driven from enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for reference to his life, including his conserved account, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven into the sea, where he sank to the bottom of the sea.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11,5 m) long, six tons weighty monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the trade journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he grub in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average around 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swelled by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater reconnaissance of the dinosaur preserved his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house residues still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>

<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, miles long Staus and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage in the late Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first indications of the police were between the connecting stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm under 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, intertwined.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There are no indications of the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was a question of slight to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, a 10-kilometre long backstage was formed.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tested "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing clues, one sits on the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepening into his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffer.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes up an unsafe or rips the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by a mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devaluate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "if the offer arrives, we will expand it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "it will probably be available at many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "" "said a railway speaker." ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the train the card devaluation without any conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers already do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: one goes on the train, calls his ticket under "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customer then appears a button for electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train attendant arrives at room Y ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, keep on working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without any ticket inspection by our train crew will simply check themselves in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"" "this allows passengers to customize their travel time by train," "" "says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr" "" "Marketing Management Board." ""</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "second plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often go by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest occasions.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of the fellow travellers not all the documents that you need to validate online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, leading to a bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the conductor in the end to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance stemming from the people's point of view, who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell, with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a fitting crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had "black experience" and "black state" countless times before this morning.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area splits people into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves a cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real classy" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While advocates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bleeds.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property in which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct markets offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie-Macher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz, with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years.</seg>

<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year sentence after making publicly classified diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman, and landmark, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg was created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created out of 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted for 20 charges in 2013, including six offences against the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this paper, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette smudge and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal to Brianne's friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic book" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo who foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelsea judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome sort of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and heavy as Donald Trump runs a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid cleavage that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "" "things happen for a certain reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"" "in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for" "" "i" "" "with her oversized signature (the" "" "i" "" "in her family name) has been an end to the" "" "automatic fragmentation" "", "the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hope to take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2160">On Monday were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants for murder, due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Local Court show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead on the scene, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police are actively seeking the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007 Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubensis, the Vice-President of University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem had now been in custody and had been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "" "said Cubensis." ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"" "speaker at the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that" "" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any possible way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2170">The testimony added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be surprised.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities will help find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>

<seg id="2180">"" "" "" "we will finish the WADA timetable in the near future" "" "- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko" ""</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"" "" "" "at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA timetable was updated in this respect," "" "said Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM annotated the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for re-setting RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "everything has been announced, everything is being implemented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list indicates that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "mutation said in relation to the matter:" "" "we carry out the investigation, because our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no state programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one wants to accept this report unconditionally," "" "added Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, RUSADA was expelled from WADA by conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July WADA-General Director Olivier Niggli, declared that RUSADA moved "in the right direction" to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - cheating.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never consistency and objectivity," Errett MEP, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite managers and address directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-polls and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ailments and which managers have low approvals - so you can re-drill why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain, so that you won't be the next Uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is a lucrative business possibility at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation, and compliance industries could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the financial-technical Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Recently, uber has registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent Business makes customized "pulse" surveys to send confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the discomfort of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company deploys Convercent, problems that previously had been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair placement - can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">"" "" "" "there is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before." ""</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have gone too much on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow employees ask yourself," "" "Do you really hear me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day, if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after the gathering of feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company will always get new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers then you will lose business.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It's about 11pm when a lot of UCLA footballers chatted on one side of the team's new practice fields.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their tricot pieces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat at the Verl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library, a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>

<seg id="2343">The meeting was also attended by the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">So the civilians in the YAS were in the headcount.</seg>

<seg id="2346">General Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar is in office, but the commander of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a leader of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just when you thought that it won't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said at the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern expandaries have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "customize" "" "his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples up to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "", "who would make a steppe-woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern scexpels have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best as possible," enthuses the site of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allurement on rapes, when one goes a step on Frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah, freeing one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On its website true Companion Roxxxy uses a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Its emergence and increasing refinement indicate a darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course have no sex robots, and while the FRR sees their growing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the marginal zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened in which there is a president in the White House who urged women to be sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most scary aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the worn out body and the stamped eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to their "personages," the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediary or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the formula of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney an epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA about how to deal with the horror of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposed to let our filtering blees burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trump to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-facing pourer who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she struggled for decades for politics, is suddenly and very especial on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it seems to me that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will no longer repel us one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans" "" "normalize" "" "Republicans, which suddenly appear as the epitome of rationality in comparison with its standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself obsessed with an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return failed) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the perpening music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park Karussell is still a strangely magical experience since two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excusable grinsing while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he reportedly suffered from prison authorities in one case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Due to murder following an appeal by prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first slaughter.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet in his home in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention, this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appel, of which they say that it was too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Law Enforcement Administration said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of it smashed, the eagle bombed his wings on a high mountain and swore.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that, the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.</seg>

<seg id="2486">The State Department reported BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose, substantial fines.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will be in Rente next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Since 31 years, Wacker has been a City Engineer.</seg>

<seg id="2539">He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is acting as a sub-contractor for the Board of Directors, the applicant must show relevant statements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">This function is intended to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it could no longer be fulfilled, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Who would like to inherit Roland Wacker should have a degree in studying architecture after the town of Haslach and have a Bachelor's degree with the subject of architecture and have good expertise in the areas of structural and construction planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the patient is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an diet rich in tryptophane encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also affects humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was accommodated separately, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were wound up in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same intolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg Urban Development informed on Wednesday in sensitivities.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened to date.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in sensing areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg still took over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>

<seg id="2678">For Schindler, previous renovations are a "success project" - in the end it is important to promote internal development and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a restructuring area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros are coming from the country, the rest from the municipality.</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, the order intake should be carried out as soon as possible, so that the renovations can start in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preventive examinations.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior civil servant of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The Connecticut helicopter was placed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the Deputy Minister of Naval Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuses is relieved by Pope John Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are the Church," declared an excuse from the former Regensburg Bishop and the present cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral captor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false estimation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the measure of "double standards" when reporting on violence at the domes.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is about "shameful and shameful acts," which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scarlia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaredia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "you like to go to the church and that's a fixed fresco." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows were a quite normal pedagogical means" "" "to cope with happy children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope John Georg Ratzinger often also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann refers to the reminder book "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became victims of overtook between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "67 domed cats sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "in summary, it can be said that von Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims were estimated to have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories of him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger, is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Premises of Non-Violence Exercises at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives an conflicting image of master builder Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as cholelitist and perfectionist who became tangible when a dome set brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best reproach him of having experienced it too late or not having taken first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the gymnasium gymnasium on which he worked was perceived as" "" "redemption," "" "" heaven "" "" and "" "" better world "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus the vast majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger exhibits an excellent testimonial, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "knowledgeable" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers, who regularly supplied the guys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to flood breakthroughs.</seg>
<seg id="2920">He was deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he did not only munch with chairs and cast the keyhole on the floor, but also scratched ear figs and pulled too happy guys on the hair or ears, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such cultivation methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are of course Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it is not more likely to do with his fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media had just plunged on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many who never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "" "" "in the media, there was a lot of information on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger include any involvement or co-knowing in terms of sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have trusted the master of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't trust even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger judge Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected to have opened up to it... Buben invincible or clearer or even more open than their parents, boarding departments, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... is unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this is how the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "in the run-up to affected students and / or their surroundings, the investigation could not be confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore acquitted of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "so he cannot be accused of having not prevented him or brought him to the show." ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link up his good name with these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former mayor Georg Ratzinger was thrown in the report" "" "Wegvisor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the primary school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, so also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful testing pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were really harassed and maladjusted and suffered terribly, all of them took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there really had to be scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the hospital gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that, as most witnesses emphasise, the theme of" "" "secondary school" "" "is taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "you were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisiacal" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic power.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at the most, the reproach remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the hospital gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he pointed out that" "" "that in the primary school, the testing penalty is still practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Given the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when testing fines were banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate the situation where the affected persons might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just isn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test sentence in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "historians are talking about" "" "the snare of anachronism," "" "that is, the danger of evaluating past and present moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times and not for what has been breached in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the practice at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I am happy that it will finally work up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of discipline and punishment, that is to say ear figs and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Does the subject matter of check-in also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not mention that he led a tight regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without claiming absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and sweets on their own, people from rebellious boys now do not make a big singer and stand before every success, whatever area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep faith and heart-good people, from whom you can't imagine that he could do anything just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive with how many former domes still today, 23 years after his Emeritierung, regularly maintain contact with him, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are therefore unequivocally in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domes are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, father-like teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovely respect person, to which they still look and worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly, all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
