28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother testified that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corp@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , shared the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was considered murder and the investigations underway .
brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston six months ago , had caught his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters commented that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his way to connect with his family was to bring us always something to prepare us for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any sort of debate .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has any information in this case will be asked to call the SF@@ PD &apos;s message on the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood Star quite clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside label that usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ g to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of TV with delicious D@@ utt and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t she brings the question of the desire for a child : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new Mother &apos;s Day &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from 25th August .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sport@@ Pyr@@ amid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues looked for a bit of change with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gold sports pyramid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted home for the feed @-@ trou@@ ghs at a fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with that the riding career finally ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he let his family run over the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even bo@@ ther for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Spor@@ ts@@ hip presented the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
a long one is the 18th winner of the pyramid of sports .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for athle@@ tic successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents for decades .
and so he also received the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 further outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master champion was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the runners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ous of the hand b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the show stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are not at stake in tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
of the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep those in doubt small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely go back to regulation , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses alike . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the future , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost wor@@ rying about that .
the democratic candidate canc@@ els the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; state @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so on Tru@@ mp we could still face any party @-@ internal discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and set up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to specifically expand renewable energy with its investment program and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ aci@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , said about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage is up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics warn him that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to ask the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say , more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are alone .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house is a refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the top of the table .
until they realize that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until one talks to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centralized units for single @-@ freeze women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away from them because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not know how to help , there are more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no .
in Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in government accommodations .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or private houses in some common shel@@ ters only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will men and women stay together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separately accessible and accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read in the rush to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we &apos;ve been around there , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new labor campaign measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deputy Assistant Doc@@ tors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute concerning a new treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC testified that ministers had agreed to deal with the wor@@ rying about the contract .
in July , assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to members published on Twitter Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persi@@ sted quietly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to problems that led to the agreement being rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Management Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaigns which commen@@ ces at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistant doctors struck six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A resident doctor , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that were advised by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 tut@@ ors and medical students , that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t MEP , said that the agreement for doctors in England would be compulsory .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded room of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile imp@@ lied , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report several times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything bad .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s eman@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the down@@ ing of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin threw out and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was done by a supposed boy@@ friend .
building up the c@@ ous@@ el will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media performed a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin obtained the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan needs primarily all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his ministry last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are economic motives as well .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
this week , the public television projected cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious about the West , as it regards its reaction to trying to take power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the slu@@ g rate of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ tied to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state secured in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to show how an analy@@ st once described me to portra@@ y the &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders . &quot; two countries that reject the West and feel badly treated and are now f@@ ading .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both pres@@ idents spoke at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the issue .
the president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey poured out the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least speak to each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s head of management , the R@@ BS brand is to be only reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer brands .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized headquarters and stock exchange are changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that are gaining more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer pursue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sporting sponsorship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become the bank of the brands , for how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ him on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori perc@@ ei@@ ves the che@@ ering when he brings the victory to Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ us had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career victories
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which reached only a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have enth@@ used fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already brought 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and grand tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already won almost 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mount , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat racing for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven , &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin Fi@@ xes Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the tigh@@ test confidence group of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that without giving reasons , Putin ordered the discharge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been representing Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief executive and chief executive of the regi@@ stran@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that it is the government &apos;s main task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysti@@ fied .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time of one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdraw@@ s at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president once upon a time to direct Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you to talk to me at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say - to entr@@ ust a job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia because a third term of Putin viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another advancing allies of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he was re @-@ elected three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved last month at a physical engagement in the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced their dis@@ mis@@ sal in a common statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal .
there were artistic differences and dis@@ agreement on the set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the Gib@@ son character from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the statement by ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love criminal mine and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a show .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of the inhabitants of Ban@@ ff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could handle sand a@@ sions that were sp@@ elled out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives around 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ et Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ hire cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ t ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ et cross @-@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete shot for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure is forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the gap to the north or the landing site .
this was achieved by pulling the northern spreading bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
he@@ ats because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat was moving on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and imagined the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boy@@ cot@@ t without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a stop@@ over , but it loos@@ ened itself from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched these men today .
hard injured - man pier@@ ces his ex @-@ girlfriend

who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens are saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors are to be put much more into duty in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Christoph Geb@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must in future show about 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the big issue in the town hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such faces , but as many as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing subsi@@ dy programme , which will cost millions and still have to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
despite this , such as Brat@@ mann , there is a tightening of the situation in the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet exist : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compensate for the loss of some 1,@@ 300 low @-@ priced apartments , whose funding is going to exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought off @-@ line ties from the city .
moreover , it would have to be thought to bring flats back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the west city , the year @-@ end periods run out .
around 1800 apartments you could get there back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they don &apos;t want the owners , the apartment building companies .
because the number of social housing in the West Bank is dr@@ astically increased , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called &quot; agitation . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few districts .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be in the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although this has concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet to be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens has been depl@@ eted in the last decade by many .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people away from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was limited to the TV , then video games and finally limited to smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a series of animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
how many pop culture phenomena declined the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to massive demand over@@ loading the server .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and as soon as they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which tra@@ verses 35@@ ,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after launching the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who exercise 30 minutes each day , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks at the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come up from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sport will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here .
but the won@@ dro@@ us thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as usual there are also m@@ alle@@ y@@ ways that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease with time .
however , due to poker &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bal@@ es creates gold in ladies &apos; ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bal@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant throughout the line .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast r@@ att@@ les on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American female Simone Bal@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating beam during the single multi @-@ battle fence of women in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title , and in total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a handful of gold back to the Spring , Texas family , would be considered a disappointment .
the American women Simone Bal@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ battle in@@ ale of women in the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
she took the first medal on Tuesday as she served on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as ex@@ clamation mark .
although it insi@@ sted on never having planned the future during its long journey to the top , it &apos;s not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak , which will last as long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ a made it easy with two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Sul@@ be@@ thon and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - lau@@ ded .
she recovered with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her end @-@ to @-@ end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the exercise of the floor , she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ ards to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest ass@@ aults ever since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a gun fire , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police said that triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y of prey , since the Att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting prov@@ oked the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in his@@ panic residential areas within four months in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , with the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown nose from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of its injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which sealed an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was that I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband , Vincent and her , have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to see her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can work with help .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or craw@@ l until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign that Ed@@ mund wrote for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic and Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still does not really know .
I haven &apos;t been asked about pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
violent ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ area floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National weather service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 @-@ 5 @-@ inch rain could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it still ra@@ ined in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger as these rivers flow slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9@@ am .
rescue teams still hat@@ ched people from flood water in the areas of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his son &apos;s son were among those who were saved near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his house , asc@@ ended strongly overnight .
he said that another step @-@ man who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water poured in and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she never saw such a state of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer could have rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floor has been completely so@@ aked by rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floods caused the rescu@@ ing of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa opened 200 floo@@ d@@ lit houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches , both of which were now flooded .
the ste@@ ward of the commune Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , shel@@ ters were arranged to accommodate the evacu@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the high tide and sand@@ bags made available to residents who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses will have been reported floo@@ ding on Thursday , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week for the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot wounds , including in the l@@ ende , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital during his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by spheres , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores said Mel@@ ench@@ z to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the radio that he is likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
also shot were three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 year old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a bon@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault rif@@ les , approached the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , were shells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given here several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police colon@@ el Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area met .
there was no arrest and the police are re@@ port@@ edly checking the surveillance video according to reports .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a squee@@ z@@ ebo@@ x on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
it reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present to myself under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three female gymn@@ asts , Simone Bal@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who have inspired many young girls of other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ licon , round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic @-@ female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Simone Bal@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they provided unexpected but master@@ ly Gy@@ ma@@ tik@@ routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americans who won Gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but it does not look like gymn@@ asti@@ cs in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie scored the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymn@@ asts in the team . this is also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but reality is such that gymn@@ asti@@ cs are expensive sports and gymn@@ asts in the first place in private gymn@@ asti@@ cs , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these gymn@@ asti@@ cs lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their whole training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bal@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ asti@@ cs .
we have to offer to the communities innum@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ asti@@ cs training .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
in my events , we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( above all black and his@@ panic ) , and national and international winners are trained .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ asti@@ cs that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ asti@@ cs develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , she motiv@@ ates so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors would like to organise more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 Assistant Doc@@ tors who voted in a vote rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first Assistance doctors are supposed to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend counsel@@ ing to improve the care of un@@ controlled times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A committee for assistance centers announced last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant doctors have still serious concerns to the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current mat@@ ernity crisis and refrain from treating all physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes triggered by discussions met with the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on ear @-@ de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was that of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistance centers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April fores@@ aw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 fut@@ ures , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors in the Stri@@ k@@ po@@ ste chain .
the ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to receive a better week &apos;s wage for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employee , urged the dentist to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work campaigns achieve nothing of the only little , but already stra@@ ined teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the assistant veter@@ in@@ arian and responded positively to concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those who come back from a vocational training period , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreement with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day drug , after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks .
the N@@ HS regulatory body has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory body has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people each year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ aches blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot det@@ aches , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ aches the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the draft of N@@ ICE published today recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health sector evaluation center said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
due to a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture makes electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man , former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk was removed last year for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored , as a devastating government report disclosed today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , which is now a anti @-@ corruption sc@@ andal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral barriers to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead an ID to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er must merely call his name and address .
the report proposes un@@ removable ink on the finger of a person when they release their electoral votes to prevent someone to vote twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to communal documents and decisions by non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial investment culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in eastern London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal ways &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person as someone else chooses .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he particularly expressed alarm on the dec@@ eit@@ ful letter @-@ election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guide of ID to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence has been indicated that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists manipul@@ ate post@@ selection documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poll@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible for voting .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists deal with complete post@@ elections and envel@@ opes of post@@ elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up barriers for electoral stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a amendment which facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the poll@@ ing cabin alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uties as un@@ suitable for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ mark controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registr@@ ations of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court verdict in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country as the mother of parliam@@ ents bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t extension of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ate &apos;s bi@@ ker doubles @-@ han@@ ger and other famous doubles from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have passed this week by French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ member of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is by no means the only athlete competing in gold that has its own famous doubles @-@ lon@@ er - at least not if you are allowed to believe in the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ pping at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ate &apos;s double @-@ han@@ ger on the bike race , many people on the internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he looks very similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see any big simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I feel this as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a step higher : this user thinks that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ er@@ .
a further comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , showing similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian Silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities as well .
theory into the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US Football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons include Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC @-@ comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; as low down &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ style floating relay he had his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been taken on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as he called , he died like a pig .
thank you for it .
the Chinese float of Ai @-@ Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC @-@ comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capit@@ ulate that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter was quick and hard , in which many people asked him .
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how un@@ aware B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like R@@ assi@@ sten . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after that , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , I &apos;m sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter
the comment@@ ator fellow Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC informed and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . B@@ yr@@ on is very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the shipment and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left business without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she picked up a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own sto@@ cking pants and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , because she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , moved out and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther anybody watching - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ antly to think someone would take shelter with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman touched her and went out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a nearby distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer to your predat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one approaches you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the bar and twist while the attack@@ er is squ@@ ir@@ ting from pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with aggres@@ sors approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , shift weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it happens in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - unless you are a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right presents his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and the worms of a serious trial by le@@ aning on some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k turned his course on a euro note , a ra@@ iling on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before le@@ aning every object , he used a lumin@@ ous phot@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he le@@ ap@@ ed more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public pur@@ ges at stations to r@@ ins@@ ing of toilets , the task put his immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was definitely able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet which he refused to lick up after their lumin@@ osity was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands were less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It comes close to the worst thing I have in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not miss anything here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ o Senior Vice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we did crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon .
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had checked out some of the things I needed to lick it , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these fil@@ thy treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and gut and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale Family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung Social Bed@@ room in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social room after a dele@@ tion with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ lon were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in irre@@ parable condition .
the walls pointed holes , wooden boards were torn up , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the administration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive shou@@ ting , stri@@ fe and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior .
in some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were rou@@ gh@@ ened
neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing brought her and her partners forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we are telling the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have given the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown site of the community house
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family since a del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is always the last step that Corn@@ wall housing takes into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message is conveyed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that s@@ wir@@ ls in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing on the floor
workers of the property administration will have to remove garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found guilty of possession of a drug of class B in trade supervision .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will navigate rent@@ ers who do not adhere to the house rules .
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall said that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication was a clear warning to the other rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after an open military jet over@@ flies
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal lived the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force contracted an incredible storm flight
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an open jet crash over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in close proximity to the sun@@ ba@@ thers at the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they started to worry about the noise of the nozzle , without seeing what was coming on them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it was flying very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast and fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to bad visibility , the jet flew lower than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no time at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four of them came to death on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force today assumed that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step on Sunday in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the return play will rise three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ bau@@ inner has to for@@ ego with the lowest Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , Go@@ alie &apos;s Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter is missing .
the German suffered a b@@ anded st@@ ump in the knee during the training , which at least clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique in this regard gave up a clear decision and did Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen ki@@ cks the advance in most other applications .
before the first mandatory match of the new season , there is doubt about the crew &apos;s fitness level , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool to 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced .
Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
Barcelona is the eleven successes of the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in an own league to table tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympi@@ asi@@ eger .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia took place .
bronze was sent to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
so it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic meeting was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sets and time outs they didn &apos;t have a coach .
they drew back to the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches until here I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said rightly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma , it was not the expected stirring match .
nevertheless , however , sufficient stunning balloon changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had pulled a rib@@ bed injury , after that , in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were , by the way , in similar high table tennis accounts .
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &quot; mighty problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the American re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states to lose their majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now announced weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment , in which the multi @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently appearing mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed such concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts arise in his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp from evangel@@ ical Christians who asked him for support in important federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt is false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sh@@ ook .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds are shaking
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ard in June , Tru@@ mp and his rival were alike from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
also Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the TV station CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards , this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event that it does not reach for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s fine , Tru@@ mp said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is alleged to have threatened to cancel mon@@ ies to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be more responsive to the arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Olympia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ ght fraud in dop@@ ing test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C is planning to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro &quot; Olympics .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary informed that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich in the Olympic Village .
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an evaluation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping Control station and gave himself up as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , left the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ yan chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich became more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan race leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences since a long time .
in the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with WA@@ DA regulations .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly indic@@ ted that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sport fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar study in Kenya as he was employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
in this way , it was possible to demonstrate that in this sport @-@ type was widespread and systematically ste@@ ered .
Russian athletes were then excluded from summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Shakespeare Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled himself with the role of Mary a childhood dream .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli is playing an older Maria .
she reminds herself of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
she is so clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
she is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m .

London School ma@@ ids , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s strongh@@ old in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the country @-@ torn land and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good in it is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other girls from the East of London climbed into an aircraft in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that Clinton will remain the Supreme Court candidate in the case of winning a candidate in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the democr@@ ats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme Ju@@ dge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nomin@@ ee were both mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also stated Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Calendar for Women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school @-@ play@@ boys distinguishes , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , it is the view that the calendar is doing too .
&quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classic nude , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the cal@@ endar@@ s .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts on mass flight
&quot; those who don &apos;t conform and Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kur@@ gan community of Germany anticip@@ ates with ten thousand protection @-@ seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the tough advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the attempted coup , the Kur@@ ds in Germany would expect a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand protected hunters from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already rev@@ oked Kurdish strongh@@ olds several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing inside Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the har@@ sh@@ ly put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees in their own country is producing refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
so Erdo@@ gan wishes to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the German government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria be positioned against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ marking as a Gü@@ len @-@ Tra@@ iler destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who don &apos;t conform and Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and the sec@@ ret@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , relying on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum @-@ rights recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and nearly 29 per cent of all who have been eligible for the treatment of asylum ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is no compensation for war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights following the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not receive anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen are not allowed to vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2021 the election of the Parliament will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more stupid than before : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not native , so are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : in the holidays car@@ egi@@ vers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate votes at the end are only lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
since 1998 , the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
it will be exciting , how heavily new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end of coalition levels .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , you can see from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and talks a little with the people , just as his legendary for@@ elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , seaf@@ aring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the flower of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time .
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations twice ; Merkel &apos;s parliament is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s no pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual election conditions on market places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country you cut off the base that it has to ex@@ ert a lot to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U candidate co@@ king to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is in the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the election of 2011 , the SPD won clearly 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the Parliament &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and transfer their electoral campaign largely into the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go on search for local stimul@@ ants among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8@@ pm , there is praise everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did it all a bit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells of the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
at the beginning of the week , the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south as scheduled , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the object is also praised for the construction of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft trips .
since the construction site has been ander@@ ed to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is back , the traffic situation within the site has eased .
the citizens can now sail from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asion by the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comforts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Florian King responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ slip road , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping ways were looking and more familiar with their navigation system than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas fran@@ ked themselves .
as the speed limits were not respected , the congregation was increasingly demanding the measuring vehicle out of M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made himself on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been over@@ heated .
the fastest was on the way with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers in the pace 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become cal@@ mer .
for business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 re@@ development has led to revenue drops in them leaves everyone who is asked to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the car deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the search engine is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most strongly held are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must be glad about every euro turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates the revenue losses at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ map has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have responded differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant will benefit from the advantages of the position on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so little is handled .
with all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regul@@ ars are now less often passing by because of the complicated transport .
if one cannot approach it , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
that his regular clientele would return to the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction works on his customers for the biggest crisis that his host has experienced in their long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , in the name of the fight against terrorism , is bol@@ ted to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what does a D@@ ul@@ ce state have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the sin@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Finance in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was based on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has taken a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
some are already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and tru@@ ce law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second attempt on proposals not to be made with the SPD : it wants to pose sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double nationality the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he does not consider this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also presenting a few new ideas .
they have partially in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are deliberately brought to the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of in@@ ventions for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw off their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally sensitive .
many of them are still un@@ extin@@ ct and leave questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about safety .
and things that people deeply concerned were not to be cl@@ utter@@ ed even during election hours .
the inner security is greatly shifted into the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are becoming increasingly in position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , between the two parties , it went high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only an extensive dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort leaders also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a departure from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re @-@ establish it , be not sensible .
and on a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot of things that could make for stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is currently attempting to distinguish itself from the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still off lightly .
in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers rise worldwide .
but it is not in all markets round .
in the recall campaign , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term .
Volkswagen will start off deliveries in the second half of the year .
thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car provider can continue to show a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW bil@@ led mainly in Western Europe and thereby bur@@ dened the total sales , as announced by the D@@ ax company .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide , 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
sales alone in Western Europe , the second most important market in China , were 14 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market Germany the deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s head of sales , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a reluct@@ ance to buy a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the attempted coup in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the exit from the EU , explained a spokesperson .
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ asses first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected pet brand of the Lower Saxony is further com@@ promised by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is attributable to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance sales from January to July .
Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software crash test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to convert into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion VW re@@ affir@@ med that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative effects .
after ref@@ itting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after retro@@ fitting , the car charger charges the customer a &quot; guarantees &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel .
the reasons for this are legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterior@@ ations will take place in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that for example , half a year after the conversion , customers can come into a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the customer interest it is important to avoid that if any other damage , which has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , comes to an uncertainty about possible guarant@@ y regulations as it was called .
that is why VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for rich depos@@ itors in future pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; head chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or daily accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : ordinary savers would not have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee charges the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund in September of private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight deposit accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 Euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 people will cost 400 Euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had for some time taken 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now passed on according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already seen four cases , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing substantial costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically sustainable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Wort made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay blanket fees for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele whose wealth is more abund@@ antly equipped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if they keep money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs are living in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently does not know any other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not let this fall in the l@@ atitude .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men of middle @-@ aged love plates .
before you go to the comment section to s@@ lay him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of Non@@ Alle@@ mont men &apos;s middle aged with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to a mid @-@ life no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild@@ ly stu@@ ffed before I stop , hold my hands and say something mad : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ os is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , do I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot via e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when she appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media track , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually have to get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record aspect of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an impetus to the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that call happy ju@@ gal memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a stack of plates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pol@@ l of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t own a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , as I browse through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older people who only slowly come in .
mo@@ p , which has devoted the sound records to almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ ist @-@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz gets gro@@ aned from loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but serious psychological trauma is hard to grasp when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
she rather makes a shop window as a wholesale purchase .
it does not deserve a lot , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I appear to muster the den@@ im pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id Cam@@ eras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the bottom Soh@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that gives out most for luxury goods like plates .
even if my inquiries showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they don &apos;t take into account the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they do not spend their Thursday morning with safety not with stro@@ lling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates while they avoid the stub@@ born look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator that rises above the shoulders of any middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects offer of demo@@ li@@ tion of stores in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais were argu@@ ing that the state should be authorised to offer 72 temporary businesses in which individuals inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigar@@ ettes to end drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also suggested that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people running the 72 provisional trading , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just to feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the down@@ fall was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; café of the camp , which is traditionally operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to maintain the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two help organisations , Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants , estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number so far - following a steep increase in newcom@@ ers throughout the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains competitive
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ cli@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to be under@@ scored .
&quot; I keep on watching the World Cup , keep confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 year old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the Su@@ gar@@ lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it is hard to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must rest in peace , which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

watching other people watching video games is a huge success - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which special@@ ises in this hobby .
how much money flows for the acquisition , Microsoft did not share on Thursday .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer until January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch other games , but also intervene .
for example , they can give up missions and counter@@ pose enemies and provide equipment .

Be@@ am is integrated in the video games department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft .
the market of live streaming of video games is growing rapidly .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation speed gauge : in various federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash@@ es are tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ ilers from Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used in places of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway jun@@ ctions or to sandy bridges with temporary speed limit , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary speed limit for compliance with speed limits .
however , a durable mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days when idle , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly experienced state , the trailer can be fitted with each car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply cl@@ amped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also fail @-@ safe outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the bl@@ under from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash@@ ed with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 copies last year .
United Kingdom reco@@ vers silver in 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji &apos;s Master@@ class receives gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle of Fi@@ j@@ is in the final on Thursday evening when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the odoro Stadium in Rio .
Fiji granted a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was defeated by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fiji had defeated a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former boss of Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan , she lost any game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lose only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and ki@@ cked off the attacks GB@@ s for fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au r@@ ushed in the corner .
after four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a bri@@ ghter T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Serra N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fiji has only stopped .
in the seventh minute Ath@@ am@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a went down a Touch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the end of the year and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ lied with further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med to the line to make a fool .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still se@@ eded .
this is the way it is .
GB gave fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for entire four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant interim play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went well for a long time in favour of the South Se@@ an Sul@@ li@@ ans , whose fans sang , sw@@ inging flags and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame pointed the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the fi@@ j@@ is rang , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB crushed lightning in the grass .
earlier on the day Fiji had conquered Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer to win a ro@@ ar victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eric gold than in these games and that will mean what is called .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 tough P@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax @-@ woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who set such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th ou@@ fla@@ ged bet , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female dancers gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one is more likely than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer who is oper@@ able and that did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , which kept the break to a minimum , if under such circumstances is the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ing morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much it means to me how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even over the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; Sta@@ y in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to do something fantastic .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , transports around 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and pastures with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ stei@@ g , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ner mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Pur@@ pose Association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency operations at weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ purchase of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always added new additions because water is the most important food for water and drinking water .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he used the water @-@ purpose association to live as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller for his part praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful man .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the plum@@ bing in the high container at Kirch@@ hoff on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained once , because one filled the hop@@ per from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly deals with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other concerned parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been known by her son , she believed that she had to die .
but the eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago was well advanced and is now studying in New York , where it is the best therapist .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that is back two years ago , when I sang to Scala in Milan , he doesn &apos;t remember anything , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko .
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Schrot@@ t .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots to partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and injured them deadly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after which he was publicly prosec@@ uted .
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is approximately 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , such as the police .
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lü@@ beck , first of all , did not want to provide any information about the Ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to eye witnesses there was a special operation kom@@ mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) at the crime scene .
steel - Light look for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from the promotion of green electricity are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in the liberation from the Renew@@ able Energy conversion in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry was threatened with an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a certificate of principle with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills , they trap an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission to generate electricity .
thus the status quo of the current regulation is largely fixed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of the emission rights trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate , as the world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw masses of steel in the world market in view of the ailing domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , imports of import duties will show effect on import steel , on the other hand , the economic outlook has risen in China .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to avoid closing down individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as steel industry association announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May the produced quantity returned for the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output .
community , spirit , health : singing does good sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s degree she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
from several perspectives S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the Deutsche Seni@@ oren@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular cooperation , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures are dissolved , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs don &apos;t get out of the pu@@ ste in everyday life too .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
S@@ ingen often has a very special effect on older people , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Senioren @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , dementia suffer@@ ers have long rec@@ eded to long @-@ lying events .
when singing , the head is also required to perform a special achievement , explains L@@ enz .
to focus simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt oneself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone are practicing not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem is growing by singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
anyone wanting to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz is advised .
you don &apos;t sing alone - for 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
if you are looking for a suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone is singing from the circle of acquain@@ tances in a senior choir , you can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical choir can contact the church or church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research .
anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the throwing of k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals has .
to their surprise , the Mi@@ ster also did not let the males cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great distress , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary School and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the rep@@ ut@@ ations of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited squ@@ ads for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation the team of researchers had already found out that the length and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ am differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
nine adult males and eight female cats were observed from the hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a lit@@ te of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised additionally .
despite the low sample for meaningful results , the researchers maintain their results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no offspring yet , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist told Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ dek@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey , an important football game takes place in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Du@@ el of the arch @-@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even at the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the daily life of ordinary citizens , should not be affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it does not stop at football either .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ dek@@ r .
according to this , the southern Texas living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ dek@@ r should be a suppor@@ ter of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup d &quot; é@@ tat of President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually has no effect on the life of most Turks however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ turn@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into tra@@ ilers and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lab@@ ic@@ ta &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club do not belong to the president &apos;s friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what unites the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their hearts beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the Pok@@ al Win@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will arrive especially again on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also leaves early in the Europa League .
in the South of Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year went better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ret@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , bor@@ rowed from the AC Florence under the contract and made known to Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the attempted coup attempt , did not come back to his European political situation after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to for@@ ego approximately one third of his estimated annual sal@@ aries to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals at Olympic Games in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin was already blocked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still the news head@@ line at the Rio Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented their start right in front of the games after a dop@@ ing barrier , was ki@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with an open smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when she saw that she was not going to get gold , the audience collap@@ sed into a j@@ ub@@ ly storm .
but there are many other athletes competing in the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is among the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its inc@@ eption , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest challen@@ ger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world championship in 2010 had to sit for a six @-@ month lock after det@@ ecting the pain using oxy@@ co@@ on .
after an operation she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 won the 2012 Olympic champion of 2012 , World Championships in 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 positively on the banned anti @-@ stimul@@ ant drug Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic dealt with the know@@ ingly capture and was closed for six months .
the four most far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big Gold@@ favor@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Peking Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , bet@@ ro@@ thed to Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has been recognized afterwards as many medals .
in 2005 , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later , after having found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympic silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the World Ranking List .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record player and Gold@@ favor@@ ori@@ tin only tested positive in May , but can still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship , references to taking a forbidden food supplement were found , the barrier of World anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and was already running on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - The Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already been able to leave it .
she planned her hom@@ ebo@@ und for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stands in constant contact with local authorities , says Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening in a residential area .
according to the police , a Thai judge was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early two le@@ aps went up again , according to the authorities another person was killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
when det@@ on@@ ated near the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong popular with holi@@ day@@ makers , a taxi driver was injured .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country a further bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive rate dropped into the air in a flower bed prior to the territorial police .
finally , there were some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast several wounded .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect this to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves as possible motives - but it is likely that the acts of Muslim rebels are likely to be done .
Thai media , too , wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not be related to the Islam@@ ist uprising or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret evidence of pending strikes in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police ordered their officials around the country to increase security around important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution executed by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to hal@@ ve chaos while the country towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ members itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rising rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several Coun@@ cils , the Constitutional Court also placed the group under observation in the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus migrants from the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we watch the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in nine federal states , Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia , the &quot; Identi@@ ty bears &quot; are already observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ iden@@ s said his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where they stand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to address them with a more you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ aß &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the constitutional complaint , possible contacts of this nature are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the significant increase in criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ iden@@ is said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be ri@@ gh@@ th@@ rop@@ rac@@ ist structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it can be true that other right @-@ wing groups of right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks on asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ats expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wor@@ rying thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum lod@@ gings have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which then radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist propaganda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records don &apos;t always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
Hab@@ asit was subsequently transformed into the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite in social networks .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old completed his race with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ names made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ room &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ meter Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also pulled .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a race over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle .
m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the Neue Platz was scre@@ ened .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old plan@@ ets@@ rie@@ der had left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when they returned at 8.@@ 15 am the next morning , about 250 euro had disappeared out of the cas@@ hier .

Tru@@ mp does not see the im@@ minent electoral defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
should it be nothing with the US president &apos;s election , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video .
he will then go on vacation .
if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the U.S. presidential election in November , it would be quite ir@@ relevant : &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very beautiful , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television transmitter CN@@ BC .
if it does not reach for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s okay , Tru@@ mp said .
he described the US President Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party more and more resistance was formed .
post increases in trade with electrical transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric car Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter also .
in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
as of next year , the postal service will also be able to offer their electric vehicles on the free market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been examining whether they are delivered to their self @-@ developed street sco@@ ot@@ ers , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ Executive Board Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there is always a question of asking , for example by arti@@ sans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ production facility , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ da had announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and long @-@ term re@@ conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July .
I can imagine that we change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ K leadership comes after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K made sense that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ences at the head of the German market research company Gf@@ K : after re @-@ dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the global number five in the sector faces a new beginning .
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Investig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahler , will leave the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
the management in the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ erk@@ inger until September 1 , shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will be the market research company in the future , is still unclear at this time .
on Friday , the shareholders welcomed the fru@@ stration of the continued success of restructuring measures initiated several years ago .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even after 5 years , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the recently bad Gf@@ K figures , every shareholder would eventually become rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that was the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were by 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent at € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
profit in the second quarter above all imp@@ acted the company &apos;s s@@ unken value vis @-@ à @-@ vis its difficult economic situation .
the business value depreci@@ ation needed in the Consumer Experience business unit of EUR 139 million secured the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the line @-@ up .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into cru@@ mb@@ les in dit@@ ch : eight injured
during an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the det@@ ain@@ ees suffered serious injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specification , had to ev@@ ade an opposite truck , which partly drove on the opposite lane .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as reported by a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the city of P@@ ew@@ all by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of sewage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth sewage system instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ ote 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sewage charge will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a regular calculation , the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the household by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach District Office found that under@@ cover runs for these wastewater facilities .
due to legal foundations , the market of Kazakhstan is obliged to operate the systems economically .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as trade and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the body , a re@@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or sub @-@ coverings from the previous period of calculation can also be equ@@ ated .
Schmidt founded the serious fee increases , making it possible for all three wastewater facilities to operate relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the small distribution basis , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , due to their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair expenditure in all three plants declined to a considerable extent , not least due to their age .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for the local area , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt indicated that in the sewage system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be f@@ lung out , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came with the continued supervision and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully penet@@ rated . &quot;
in the process , Schmidt , the market community of large @-@ scale entertainment costs , has been spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
according to stone houses , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal waste water association is not to be expanded , because these facilities are defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria posted for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian carto@@ ons
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting .
the filters are non @-@ bloo@@ ded , revol@@ ving tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps are brought to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they have been accused of promoting black face convey@@ ance or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested to some users a filter which gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow spotted . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders experienced racism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , wrote in an e @-@ mail , whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and th@@ inn@@ y said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluct@@ ant Asi@@ atic car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ face has been drawn into the degra@@ ding extrem@@ ity .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural mine .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who in terms of race are more diverse than their older counterpart - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things go un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , working as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that race @-@ based controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has left Sn@@ ap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a personnel officer focusing on sub @-@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said she will have her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military command for@@ fei@@ ts IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects the Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command modified intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed on site , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the army committees , intelligence committees , and the budget@@ ary com@@ it@@ ant , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command &apos;s intelligence agencies , who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence gathering , typically dismissed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com agencies , regularly recorded a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com are reaching the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed reporting problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com spokes@@ man publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ cow@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s leaders changed intelligence reports to bring down the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations continue .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense .
democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cent@@ Com &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; created a dispro@@ portion@@ ate process for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest @-@ ranking democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ook the morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for diver@@ ging opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated no evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; definite political view &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s inspec@@ tor who were taken up after complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ tor are still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have further implications for the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
however , the alle@@ gations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ ing military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recall the constraints of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements by the government , air strikes against the government held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , has been critic@@ ised by members of the legislature on account of his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of the women , a show@@ down with the UK is on hand
one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
however , she knows that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place that will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will go slightly longer for the strong Dutch women who run the other group .
whatever the game may go out on Saturday , Americans have caused a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they ended up at the last of 12 places at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the squ@@ ad .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , became a coach of the national team and began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the Work@@ place in London that we now have .
we have been able to sweep the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand from the close range .
India was without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 up to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball through the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and kno@@ cked the ball to the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa GP made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the United States go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympics .
the Rio de Janeiro &quot; events feel consistent and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ athlon .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the queue in the queue , without hearing about Simone Bal@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ verk@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a women &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , could well have been under these familiar names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swim and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should have enough arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has already been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so spar@@ sely noticed that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and until 2012 an athlete had managed it until the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds suitable for an un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but just a learned enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact - but also the gra@@ p@@ ness of gymn@@ asi@@ um and diving , the two sports that essentially unites it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stepping stone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and o@@ int@@ ments ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are rated according to the official &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to continue in their pursuit of gold farther , faster , upwards and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes towards the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also another high @-@ end goal in tel@@ ev@@ ised broadcasting : the world &apos;s or the olymp@@ ic record .
the goal @-@ oriented quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2 : 00 p.m .
in the midst of the Olympics they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objectiv@@ ity of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his new fan base after the air .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more territories .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that police officers fired and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council now calls for a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader in the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or to prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options besides prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ You@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the governing coalition .
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who were forced more or less in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess tend to explo@@ de under the surface after years of de@@ bit@@ ing .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the Internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ co@@ m , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ sei . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ sei .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ sei have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say he was particularly well @-@ vers@@ ed in taking early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to occupy the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia was experiencing such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands protest against elections , which according to analysts said apparently by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though they were less than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but evi@@ dently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters arrived in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an town , conducted by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights across the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim to Obama to have been founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multi @-@ repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
it also brings his comrades , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant at all .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp avoided the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp told in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was totally serious .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can pres@@ idency didn &apos;t want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism le@@ ashes down on Mr. Tru@@ mp while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign on falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this topic again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestion would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said the Russians had to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said &quot; Of course , I thought that sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ecting the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp adopted an even more plau@@ sible tone , as its cargo flows continued to decline .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a major advance in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally tempted to not excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable position to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent people , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statement whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State .
it is true that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ banks , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by taking control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of back@@ sliding on each of his words and being taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tel@@ ev@@ isions who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s as an excuse as only another proof that he was un@@ fit for the presidential office .
once driven over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fla@@ vor@@ ful café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced .
soap Cher@@ ie shop , set up in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , except the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is a change , it is also a new discovery .
a re@@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new outside station , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ as like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural tears .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regul@@ ars .
&quot; many old customers were also ou@@ sted by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the club regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual coffee table , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth to seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business had taken the old business room .
indeed , the owners of soap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to leave them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ ey said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming felt .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land ter@@ rap@@ in soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es &apos;s latest book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the US , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they show culinary solidarity as they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ u@@ chy snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixes .
when the repor@@ ter ordered ham@@ mer@@ ing , this found the couple suitable for discussing the food during the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which extends the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You Can E@@ at Buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male Fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the ways the country was moving with it no longer to be the land of shame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; replied Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was also ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ due , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ sa@@ vory ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the focus of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
unique bl@@ ends have been tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction takes preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man made a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the family business recipes .
as never before , or since then , budget economics - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - has der@@ ailed the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ h@@ lets such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ E@@ ating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like the million @-@ million man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated pan@@ try and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully alien to reality .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to take an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in taste establishments by Ms Roosevelt added that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded once the country came back on its feet .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple began to understand the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the fall of the wind .
after the plates were disp@@ at@@ ched at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert that they had cooked at home : the ple@@ dge recipe that President Roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a fancy name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped somewhat reluct@@ antly a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E picked up three times a night .

killed in bombing : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group that according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung had saved almost 60,000 people in life .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives at the risk of pulling people out of bom@@ bed houses and providing first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil shield , which shows him at an 11 hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar herself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eradi@@ cate the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ irs usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland ha@@ ired only with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms down at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it reaches it , the five meter long animal will accelerate at a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a seal .
however , this lifestyle characterized by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ chen comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long assumed that Greenland ha@@ irs become stone .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland ha@@ irs are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius , they mostly appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland ha@@ irs .
their slow @-@ motion was , as they pointed out six animals in front of Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen , with a transmitter .
this sh@@ arks still make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers that tor@@ ment from higher water @-@ layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ arks , who f@@ isher between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 cm long , while the biggest shar@@ k was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens originates from the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins in it will no longer be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus .
their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons attempted to sp@@ ill large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res in length , the core of the lens , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons tests , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all larger Greenland ha@@ irs had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities in their lens core , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ired with the increase obviously had at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on spar@@ rows .
so they mature later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very big .
the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more danger@@ ously and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ chen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources rather into a long life .
building site in double pack
in the recent session , the Municipal Council has focused on issues relating to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee adopted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the plot , par@@ cel@@ i@@ fication and development issues were clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons for sur@@ veying could be placed , the sale of the plots in the residential areas of &quot; street traffic &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is nothing more in the way to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the land areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in the same way .
as it was said , volunteers can now sign up in the Town Hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September meeting .
in order to be able to demand en@@ quiries for the settlement of further business enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the new land use plan , which was newly created in the spring of this year , in sub @-@ areas .
in the area of sub @-@ time expos@@ ures , the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main has therefore the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the I@@ W &apos;s Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK has so far been sufficient for them .
these are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk record ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
although Luxembourg holds a large fund industry , it will also cut off the infrastructure of Dublin as well as Dublin .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
in addition , the city offers easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not that easy to find high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than on the Main River .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , and less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg on No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin on No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my econom@@ ists believe .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including opinion and other in@@ ethical actions .
in the case of rising law@@ suit on Thursday , US secretary Beth Clu@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction in costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck inv@@ aded each other and claimed property on laboratory work , as Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir ground@@ work , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just run clean@@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton to earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton received USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ em@@ or@@ aries ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice pres@@ idency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements of the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false speeches and dec@@ ei@@ vers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for ref@@ using to refuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax audi@@ ts were not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business units and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , asking the senior Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co has announced that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp paid no or only very few taxes , and a business journalist in the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , suggest@@ ing that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , ex@@ changing Tru@@ mp to meet their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahead of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has resum@@ ed tax return until 2007 .
the Clinton , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clinton of 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans .
their main investment investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , has intensified its promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is World telep@@ hon@@ y day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ ard Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include lighting of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom fires up with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust into the air .
a hint is usually already enough to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a thro@@ wer which shoots a gold cra@@ ck@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council votes unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk new building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

however , the city council now unanim@@ ously rejected the proposal for the construction of a sales ski@@ pper at the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ ball@@ kon@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk doesn &apos;t go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath to the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director breaks Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre @-@ election as it had demanded Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; published his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s national selection list .
the country was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
written by Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer that he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the employee of Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big response from the Internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some subordin@@ ate to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have indul@@ ged in the supposed promp@@ ts of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly denied all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has been added .
police use tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system .
the police arrested tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started as police officers attempted to disper@@ se the students , which led to police rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants saw Gra@@ ffi@@ kon against P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary President Michel Tem@@ er to spray walls .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in businesses grew strongly , shared the ambass@@ adors .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade break was achieved through deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan dates from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign representatives held about 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
witnesses requested : beverage market flooded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the restra@@ int of a gun , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the issuing of cash from the beverage store &apos;s employees and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured , the police do not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and badly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
the perpetr@@ ators must be scann@@ ed in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel parking place situated opposite the car park entrance with the silver colored car possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
who has made observations at the time of the crime ( around 19.@@ 45 hrs ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently contact the police .
Nag@@ old : playing and fun during summer leisure time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the children &apos;s reserve Nag@@ old with their assistants on their summer leisure time in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the quiet recreation theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle during the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , we went to B@@ oko with the visit of the mat@@ ch@@ z@@ oos .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ks .
children and car@@ ers were culinary with their prepared star@@ ters such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ et@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
workshops were made , beautiful pieces of jewellery made of pearls and stones , or made of wood , a Roman @-@ Mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful evening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrimage to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stries from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ ting @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch in St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
together , four stages were accomplished .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stries in probably two years , the senior minist@@ erial round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at Freiburg Min@@ ster .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ol , and Ha@@ ze &apos;s hole , and holy rooms , set themselves on the way .
in the evening before , pastor of Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage , and told the Pil@@ gri@@ ms .
von Hor@@ b was driven by rail to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved Lady stood and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was tram@@ pled from the cathedral .
the individual daily tours were framed in the morning and evening by a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way the Min@@ is started to sing again and again on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgri@@ m song booklet .
for overnight stays , the parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal .
at the stage enzi@@ ele Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and the breakfast .
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day we took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first we had to absol@@ ve some 500 metres of altitude and then climbed again .
in the evening , the deserved reward was a common barbecue on the badge .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg on the final stage .
the Min@@ is were visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happily arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks to God .
at the evening mass in Münster the Min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage destination by Co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the metropolis of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home as Br@@ ite Gold reign@@ s for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s racing Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . he proudly made the legend when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they scored only a modest sixth place at the London train world championships in London despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y si@@ ashed - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders prevailed in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was slightly back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , moving in a higher gear in order to slow down and to enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y watched from his position as a BBC expert and dropped out Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an Olympia ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der admitted that he fell on track after a weak start .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal by England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on March 23 ( apparently a sacred date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that would be equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y next takes part in the spr@@ int that will start today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had cont@@ ested with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and completed tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong web team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ bing repro@@ aches as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in velo@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation GB@@ s , which at the perfect moment has reached its climax , will be repeated again .
future of the melt of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy supply in question
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus raises all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy imposed for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2,000 work@@ stations in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk in case of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the sm@@ el@@ ting consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa made the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the mel@@ ee of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closing .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L further stated that the Tre@@ aties were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing businesses &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force as of November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L stated that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual decline in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expecting a cancellation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have come into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it has res@@ igned from the treaty .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to analysts at the start of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts annually and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der , and went to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , sp@@ ook@@ y reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ ha@@ ired action of almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; ) , with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister , Kim , likes her what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine , the output is attracting a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were advertis@@ ers from the 8@@ 32 pages of the R@@ PG 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover stars is eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine se@@ eping through before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that are model@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to denom@@ in@@ ators ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did , she called them &quot; the mi@@ sty pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings turned up again when the news came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but walking around the gri@@ ev@@ ousness seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in the Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
common denom@@ inations annually assign 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies are presented annually by the common denom@@ inations , while the industry anticip@@ ates the impact of further medium @-@ cuts on over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - have been dismissed at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ crowded , are prepared for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s community &apos;s community centres said that the last cen@@ sus of the National Union of Public Service Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been dismissed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision by the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s common centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families going through separ@@ ations , workers who have been dis@@ dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the federal government will cut its funding by 30 percent since June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Federal Justice Minister and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short @-@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the common denom@@ inations and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k has invested in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp Leg@@ ged Campa@@ ign accused of re@@ taining weapons
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s Campa@@ ign was accused of in@@ activity after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina tried a fire@@ arm for one employee in February while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i agreed to have waited for months that the affair would be settled internally before it realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Camp@@ agn@@ ist , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand @-@ finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the course in Vinc@@ enzo Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; he gave in his indictment .
after he compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , he found that at least four other people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded a ri@@ ot when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges should appoint .
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign concluded that the media had torn his words out of context and that he wouldn &apos;t inc@@ ite violence .
ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and Philip because of bodily injury and lasting psychological damages .
Tru@@ mp@@ s press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
responding to calls at his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) significant losses are recorded for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this revealed representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could just continue to rule , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to be the head of the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could again rise to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament .
despite moderate losses of 6 per cent ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens came back to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented at the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent each .
according to the survey , according to the survey by the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they still stood behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent in the House of Represent@@ atives for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , while the pirates would not miss the entry in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors are domin@@ ating the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ unk@@ y .
in the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice for approximately two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro lovers can buy the devices still on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the Western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could receive a lot for those standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even via fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even accessing websites was possible via HTML browsers , albeit sc@@ ary slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
the market today masters suppliers that came all a lot later than Nokia .
to be online always and everywhere is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices were sold , and Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunic@@ ation companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the launch of i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use per touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march started , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the draw@@ back .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course .
on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get away the smartphone once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , as in 2012 in London , when we took a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
we already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips for our local communities , creating 40,000 new jobs and putting an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the enlargement of He@@ a@@ throw is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked to him .
like the Olympic Games He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual an infra@@ structural project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion of fun growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the broad@@ ening of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass the blocking of ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse play . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ ing on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it communicated that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertising to make it difficult to detect indicating which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of hate @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the line @-@ seeking open source community and the hang@@ ers has already been in progress since the invention of indicator lock@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator lamps have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ wages and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide use the scor@@ pion , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook on their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebook .
apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man shared .
advertising on desktop PCs constitutes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying new filters , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt instrument , which is why we instead focused on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control in the hands of people .
woman with suspicion of presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was convic@@ ted by a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , asking these as well as any witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , told G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not being held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing , after crossing and killing a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took the judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had answered a call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfectly exceptional and un@@ predictable situation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably once populated .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had Earth @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still sp@@ un slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus increases its day@@ bed side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates thick layers of clouds , which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously assumed by planetary researchers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to excessive heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burnt away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had fired up Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season , Roy has won the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed in each of the last two years the post @-@ season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ di@@ ee@@ pers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resume talks , go on strike &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labor disputes relating to the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all parties sit down for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a few full @-@ day sessions in the next few weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ tops in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ at@@ rend with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star @-@ pile to different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the quick@@ est .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars come up with large amounts of star win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have an braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars more slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; says Reb@@ ull .
since the cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still a lot to find out about how , when and why stars de@@ cel@@ er@@ ate their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star emerges
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional return , the 41 year old pro will face the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected as the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez returns for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed to mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players present similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave birth to ster@@ oids banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funding through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a law@@ suit the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time sweet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again given the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win every game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationship with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy @-@ and @-@ kindness of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch @-@ riv@@ alling Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ k@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
catch : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland won &apos;t be allowed to start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a knowled@@ geable athlete would have gained almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases became known as the Rio de Janeiro &quot; Olympic Games .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Z@@ il@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ k@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil .
in Ch@@ en the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the CA@@ S International Sports Court confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have been able to participate in the courses over 50 m of Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B Trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news perme@@ ated the positive test at Dan@@ i@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on its own offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV broad@@ caster B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the ban on the ban on blood dop@@ ing may be EP@@ O .
Dan@@ i@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly announced his criticism of the people of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had been tested three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both deny the intake , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the Dan@@ k@@ ova case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , including the nation of Kenya producing numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in the swimming sport , the earlier links in China also ensured intense confron@@ tations between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sh@@ ly .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for lo@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun was positively tested by the Chinese nation@@ als on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down for a three @-@ month lock .
data @-@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmer of black@@ mail malware uses targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ e@@ ytes of 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software , according to the Malaysi@@ an observations , to attack corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to reimbur@@ se ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ ter@@ hofer @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most painting programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ aches took place in the past few months quickly .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches deliberately for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als last@@ ingly .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ pres@@ ser .
in order to get the final code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ grams .
however , where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware is added .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt their business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will regain their data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of down@@ times in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure explored the user interfaces and contact with black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
you tell their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private persons are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate very hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four people .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ pres@@ ser .
the latest malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware themselves , offering advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price of $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a tool for adjustment so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ids then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so , one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and mand@@ ates another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known among many companies that better back up their data .
more than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the mal@@ war@@ ter@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful black@@ mail , the perpetr@@ ators will instead thre@@ aten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ ter@@ gab@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the perpetr@@ ators could also completely new targets in the internet of things to the grain in the future .
at the CO Conference on Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could control a thermo@@ stat associated with the Internet .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda &apos;s HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cockpit top falls off there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 litres of folded back arm@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded like chin @-@ chairs and thus offer storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded easily , however , the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should however perform his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another version of the engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the City @-@ emergency brake assist ( works at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant are part of the safety systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision War@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the smart gam@@ er responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required .
but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI connector are located beneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel starting from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible if there are dangers that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of illness : when does the organizer get paid
ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money after their trip if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests are reported to have the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their vac@@ ations .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease returned the holi@@ day@@ makers to a defective pla@@ inti@@ ff , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was of the opinion that the journey had been fla@@ wed with it - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs were not successful in court .
indeed , the wastewater treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organis@@ er was informed only shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so judgment .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
certainly , our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and sch@@ ism .
we won &apos;t grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if perpetr@@ ators would have to leave the country faster , this would increase security and strength as well as the consent of the population for refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is to be improved , the tru@@ ce has been updated so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult .
the last much discussed duty of silence for doctors is supposed to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , for example , on mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against action against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a cow@@ ard@@ stick for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated calls from the Union following a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship earlier .
according to a general prohibition of full @-@ wear it remains problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green Chief of the Interior , Simone Peter , accused the minister to simul@@ ate energy and capacity for action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et pro@@ verb@@ s and tightening of the right of residence will not bring people in this country any more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it regularly st@@ alls on the road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the right @-@ wing vote shall be extended .
this is a good news for all motor@@ cyclists who are standing in traffic on the environmental street every night when driving over the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler road exit at 700 metres .
drivers can then directly cross the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic spl@@ its up early , thus improving the total workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West .
the train ride on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers most of all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back @-@ sta@@ u reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h path and sometimes even further .
the reason is the needle hole on the B 51 shortly before the exit to the Wes@@ eler road .
from here , traffic is only ste@@ ered in a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back almost a quarter of a century ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to take in particular the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane .
as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected plant @-@ day traffic jam will continue , the competent state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art operation cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official period of rest until 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state enterprise deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities it was to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
traffic will be tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables youths with mig@@ r@@ atory and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the children &apos;s house Forest School has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 pupils visited the production at the Small House between 11 and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with mig@@ r@@ atory and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most youngsters of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it has been possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , so the press release of the young theatre Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from language schools , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without a refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language education are in the planning stage .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; project continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association reck@@ ons with many classes who want to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has taken the Star Be@@ e Gu@@ ck@@ ern in south@@ western Germany on the night to Friday a stroke of the bill - but there is still hope .
the night had been bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are per@@ sei@@ des , which are among the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , that goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , and in the morning you can no longer think of sleep long before the bell rings .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of the adults have sleep problems and more than ten percent sense their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing .
how can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can cause a variety of causes , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore an on@@ e- and through @-@ sleep @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance .
just going through sleep many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this , organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs are stuck .
in@@ frequently , sleeping disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are dependent on one another .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc incident can be bad , wake up every two or three hours and possibly start sal@@ uting about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep distur@@ b@@ ance become a doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is adver@@ sely affected by the day should visit the doctor .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : you are beaten down , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to allevi@@ ate the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there are hardly any psycho@@ therapists in Germany , empha@@ sizing Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Hospital in Berlin .
therefore one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems , advises her .
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for example , in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory drop@@ outs , physicians advise doctors to study in the sleep laboratory , for diseases of the daily fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the disgu@@ ise you go to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera shows the sleeping person at the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws you can put on for a better sleep .
wear out : regular sleeping and stopping times , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately , and that is completely non @-@ condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to do
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time at the world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook has prot@@ ested against his ex @-@ team @-@ mates who are under criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king 150@@ ,000 euros , nobody should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night on Friday .
the transport system in swimming sport is bad , however , dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate on dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election ham@@ bur@@ gers who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Tra@@ des arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the civil flag of the Düsseldorf police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had made several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage @-@ pil@@ es as ban@@ de .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft off@@ ences .
the two women and two men have been committed to several off@@ ences since the middle of July and were in a joint , division , and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the crime comm@@ iss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves submitted specifically to conduct criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
in total , they had more than 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , a couple of liner bro@@ o@@ ks , and a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones in between : the R@@ ī@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ hain serves at first sight , but the police belong to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one walks along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a beer shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is supposed to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already being built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichs@@ hain refers , however , will be fav@@ ored in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the tenants have rented lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has spoken out several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been evacu@@ ated by 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and refra@@ ined from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raises three children , are mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern for rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wished for several local police protection against the v@@ and@@ als left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin intern@@ at@@ ator and the police force between home occup@@ ants and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
in contrast to the rest of the city , Friedrichs@@ hain in East Berlin was in fact a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police supplies in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing liners from all over the world : with them residents of GDR times and former home @-@ occupied residents share their Kie@@ z .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they are recognis@@ able from inv@@ oked pan@@ es or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been cast with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crime like body injury is , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to meet new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years beside the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is appe@@ as@@ ingly : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined .
even the famous burning cars are no longer there anymore in the Riga .
for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately dra@@ gged into the R@@ ī@@ ga Street .
therefore it was also so important that the residents get back their road : from the police , politicians and the media , which in July all of a sudden claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which sup@@ plant the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - rather people who are not so well bet@@ ro@@ thed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never stops ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for those who are fond of color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub , can complain bad about noise there .
all persons introduced only with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee tra@@ der
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the Refu@@ ge@@ e Commissioner for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of the administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working groups for refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine customers from the working group indicate that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the s@@ worn Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which has above all a problem .
thus some - less mo@@ cking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place .
an administrative specialist was looked for with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an egg @-@ cutting wool mil@@ k@@ es@@ sow .
but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing this for about six weeks .
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports both honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers stand in the Was@@ en@@ strasse
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the council office to the commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it doesn &apos;t work so far as to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be ch@@ ast@@ ened as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be installed in the Was@@ en@@ strasse .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , scho@@ oly@@ ards , one @-@ euro jobs and ou@@ tre@@ ach for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive exterior effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sport , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here are administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling at some point can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , it will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the customer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a mamm@@ oth task .
a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach , after the recent incidents ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents were also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins were sum@@ mon@@ ing them completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants should soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors themselves .
actually , it is unfair to provide them with hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bach are already busy integrating the previous people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women are united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
