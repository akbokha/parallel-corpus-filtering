<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the future, Trump and Clinton are almost worrying about that.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate cancels the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the Republicans "state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>

<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage is up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded room of St. Petersburg Palastes, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile implied, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report several times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's emanating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the downing of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin threw out and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was done by a supposed boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the cousel will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media performed a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin obtained the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs primarily all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his ministry last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives as well.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the public television projected cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to return.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious about the West, as it regards its reaction to trying to take power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the continued resentment of the slug rate of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pitied to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state secured in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to show how an analyst once described me to portray the "Alliance of outsiders." two countries that reject the West and feel badly treated and are now fading.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both presidents spoke at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey poured out the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least speak to each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin Fixes Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years, IVANOV was part of the tightest confidence group of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin it is that without giving reasons, Putin ordered the discharge of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been representing Ivanovs since 2012, was named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is called (in Russian) that he later was the chief executive and chief executive of the registrant.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think that it is the government's main task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mystified.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdraws at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president once upon a time to direct Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you to talk to me at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say - to entrust a job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia because a third term of Putin violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another advancing allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he was re-elected three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of Queenshire crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queenset cross-ring." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete shot for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure is forward-looking high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the gap to the north or the landing site.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern spreading bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heats because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "Building for action" "" "at the next session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But quarrel is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD leader Christoph Gebmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must in future show about 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such faces, but as many as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem," "" "says Bratmann:" "" "there is no agreement between the fractions at the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, such as Bratmann, there is a tightening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not yet exist: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compensate for the loss of some 1,300 low-priced apartments, whose funding is going to expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought off-line ties from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreover, it would have to be thought to bring flats back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west city, the year-end periods run out.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get there back in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they don't want the owners, the apartment building companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the West Bank is drastically increased, one removes itself from the goal of so-called "agitation."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social-weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "s & D Group president Holger Herlitschke says:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens has been depleted in the last decade by many.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people away from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was limited to the TV, then video games and finally limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a series of animation, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many pop culture phenomena declined the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to massive demand overloading the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and as soon as they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the cell phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which traverses 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after launching the game, the number of follow-up people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays the Pokémon Go - it only looks at the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come up from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "", "because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sport will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wondrous thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual there are also malleyways that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to poker's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold back to the Spring, Texas family, would be considered a disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a winning streak, which will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa made it easy with two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sulbethon and Bodenturnen - in which Biles holds the World Championship title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered with 15,433 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was another one.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her end-to-end - a pure formality - and tears poured on biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book-book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present to myself under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many young girls of other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, the Catholicon, round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic-female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they provided unexpected but masterly Gymatikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth heterosexual Americans who won Gold at an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but it does not look like gymnastics in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie scored the same path as Aly and Madison to make it the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts in the team. this is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality is such that gymnastics are expensive sports and gymnasts in the first place in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their whole training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Bales, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer to the communities innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events, we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (above all black and hispanic), and national and international winners are trained.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thanks, she motivates so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman, former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk was removed last year for corruption from office</seg>

<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and the worms of a serious trial by leaning on some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk turned his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaning every object, he used a luminous photometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "brought some surprising results to light." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to lick the rinsing button of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he leaped more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public purges at stations to rinsing of toilets, the task put his immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was definitely able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the luminous number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet which he refused to lick up after their luminosity was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "It comes close to the worst thing I have in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not miss anything here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio Senior Vice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuormaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we did crazy brainstorming that ended up saying" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film, added:" "" "let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had checked out some of the things I needed to lick it, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these filthy treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and gut and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asoziale family left her social room after a deletion with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebillon were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls pointed holes, wooden boards were torn up, trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the administration of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive shouting, strife and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was in June an arrangement for anti-social behavior.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were roughened</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly invoked the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing brought her and her partners forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have given the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown site of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the renter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family since a delogification is always the last step that Cornwall housing takes into consideration." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message is conveyed that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the property administration will have to remove garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after having found guilty of possession of a drug of class B in trade supervision.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were covered with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that they will navigate renters who do not adhere to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall said that the delogification was a clear warning to the other renters who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives do not receive anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from Nordrhein-Westfalen are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.</seg>

<seg id="5">More stupid than before: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not native, so are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays caregivers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, spread flyers and enumerate votes at the end are only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>

<seg id="13">It will be exciting, how heavily newbie AfD cuts off and what remains in the end of coalition levels.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, you can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks a little with the people, just as his legendary foreloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations twice; Merkel's parliament is located in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="27">"" "the advice of the CDU candidate coking to his comrades is also self-revealing:" "" "you must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is in the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of AfD (19)." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">Since the construction site has been andered to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is back, the traffic situation within the site has eased.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 redevelopment has led to revenue drops in them leaves everyone who is asked to look through.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant will benefit from the advantages of the position on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so little is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all charges, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regulars are now less often passing by because of the complicated transport.</seg>
<seg id="41">If one cannot approach it, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his regular clientele would return to the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction works on his customers for the biggest crisis that his host has experienced in their long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen is able to see that for example, half a year after the conversion, customers can come into a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the comment section to slay him under the pseudonym of NonAllemont men's middle aged with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed re-emergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to a mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wildly stuffed before I stop, hold my hands and say something mad: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, do I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when she appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25 who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media track, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually have to get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record aspect of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received an impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that call happy jugal memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the colt of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flutes from a stack of plates." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A poll of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just came here recently and said," "" "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record, so that I can put them on the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people who only slowly come in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mop, which has devoted the sound records to almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexist-packed Pop instead of experimental jazz gets groaned from loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but serious psychological trauma is hard to grasp when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a shop window as a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve a lot, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives off with a dearded sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I appear to muster the denim pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid Cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the bottom Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that gives out most for luxury goods like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my inquiries showed that the results of YouGov vote, they don't take into account the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They do not spend their Thursday morning with safety not with strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates while they avoid the stubborn look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator that rises above the shoulders of any middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais were arguing that the state should be authorised to offer 72 temporary businesses in which individuals inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to end drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also suggested that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional trading, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" "" "absolutely comprehensible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just to feed people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the downfall was the Jungle Book Kids "café of the camp, which is traditionally operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to maintain the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two help organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - following a steep increase in newcomers throughout the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers must adapt to the next generation speed gauge: in various federal states, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashes are tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailers from Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used in places of accident, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway junctions or to sandy bridges with temporary speed limit, there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary speed limit for compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a durable mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days when idle, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans by time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the highly experienced state, the trailer can be fitted with each car with trailer hitch according to the manufacturer.</seg>

<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the blunder from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle of Fijis in the final on Thursday evening when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the odoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji granted a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was defeated by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji had defeated a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for the UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss of Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost any game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lose only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and kicked off the attacks GBs for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run into running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards as Osea Kolinisau rushed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">After four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A brighter Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Serra Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji has only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Athamasa Veremalua went down a Touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the end of the year and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou complied with further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB gave fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for entire four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went well for a long time in favour of the South Sean Sullians, whose fans sang, swinging flags and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame pointed the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fijis rang, the fijis hugged and GB crushed lightning in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji had conquered Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a scarce half-finals match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinaleric gold than in these games and that will mean what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 tough Pieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in the second without a tax-woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who set such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th ouflaged bet, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female dancers gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one is more likely than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who is operable and that did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, which kept the break to a minimum, if under such circumstances is the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was a member of the kennel association for 31 years, has 28 years of age as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water-purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, transports around 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and pastures with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchsteig, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current president, Breitbrunner mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was set up as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Purpose Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency operations at weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high container (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the repurchase of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and I have always added new additions because water is the most important food for water and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of lifeblood for his water-purpose association and he used the water-purpose association to live as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group to the nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller for his part praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful man.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well-being and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the plumbing in the high container at Kirchhoff on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can be maintained once, because one filled the hopper from Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water-purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it remains in the liberation from the Renewable Energy conversion in the existing plants for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry," "" "said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "" "(WAZ, Friday issue)."

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate, as the world's largest producer of producers threw masses of steel in the world market in view of the ailing domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imports of import duties will show effect on import steel, on the other hand, the economic outlook has risen in China.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does good seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's degree she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">From several perspectives Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the Deutsche Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular cooperation, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures are dissolved, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs don't get out of the puste in everyday life too.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singen often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia sufferers have long receded to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is also required to perform a special achievement, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To focus simultaneously on one's own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt oneself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone are practicing not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem is growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone wanting to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz is advised.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - for 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">If you are looking for a suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone is singing from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can contact the church or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="5">Whether from the further explosions on the holidayisland of Phuket as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also Austrian citizens, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stands in constant contact with local authorities, says Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was initially exploding two bombs on Thursday evening in a residential area.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai judge was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday early two leaps went up again, according to the authorities another person was killed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">When detonated near the seaside resort of Patong popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country a further bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive rate dropped into the air in a flower bed prior to the territorial police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, there were some detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks bear the same signature," "" "said Army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we expect this to be a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express themselves as possible motives - but it is likely that the acts of Muslim rebels are likely to be done.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media, too, wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not be related to the Islamist uprising or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which is limited to restricted areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "in recent days, the authorities have kept secret evidence of pending strikes in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police ordered their officials around the country to increase security around important government buildings, airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but most of the time they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace used for years by Thailands king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the well-known bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need to travel to these provinces." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution executed by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to halve chaos while the country towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, remembers itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rising rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old completed his race with a setback of 48 seconds and took the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>

<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as trade and industrial companies from Welsh, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>

<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or sub-coverings from the previous period of calculation can also be equated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian cartoons</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein's painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-blooded, revolving tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps are brought to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they have been accused of promoting black face conveyance or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested to some users a filter which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow spotted."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, wrote in an e-mail, whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter was "hurtful and thinny said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluctant Asiatic caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been drawn into the degrading extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural mine.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who in terms of race are more diverse than their older counterpart - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats creates a picture that is insulting for a user," "" "so it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed when it was the case," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, working as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that race-based controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military command forfeits ISIS intelligence, rejects the Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command modified intelligence information to draw an optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed on site, an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Preliminary Report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the army committees, intelligence committees, and the budgetary comitant, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command's intelligence agencies, who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering, typically dismissed by high-ranking CentCom agencies, regularly recorded a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom are reaching the top top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed reporting problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom spokesman publicly announced that a military reconquest of Moscows could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's leaders changed intelligence reports to bring down the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the" "" "CentCom" "" "created a disproportionate process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "shook the morality among analysts and" "" "gave too little room for diverging opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated no evidence of a White House intervention in the CentCom analysts regarding a" "" "definite political view" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's inspector who were taken up after complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the general inspector are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further implications for the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honouring military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recall the constraints of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements by the government, air strikes against the government held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's damal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, has been criticised by members of the legislature on account of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3-0.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro "events feel consistent and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristwatch to the turner to the triathlon.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the queue in the queue, without hearing about Simone Bales, Katie Leverky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a women's black with dimples, could well have been under these familiar names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should have enough arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has already been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so sparsely noticed that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and until 2012 an athlete had managed it until the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a trampoline has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds suitable for an unenlightened ear for a clownsschule as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just a learned enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grapness of gymnasium and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "stepping stone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and ointments) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are rated according to the official" "" "Olympics" "" "according to execution, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to continue in their pursuit of gold farther, faster, upwards and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes towards the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also another high-end goal in televised broadcasting: the world's or the olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatiguing when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2: 00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympics they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his new fan base after the air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police officers fired and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Council now calls for a thorough investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader in the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options besides protesting, it breaks out," "" "said SeYoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness tend to explode under the surface after years of debiting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian high countries, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Orocom, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to co-ordinate under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of the Orosei." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Orosei have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly well-versed in taking early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to occupy the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia was experiencing such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protest against elections, which according to analysts said apparently by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last months and this period of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters arrived in Gondar, an amharan town, conducted by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights across the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim to Obama to have been founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multi-repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades, who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump avoided the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump told in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidency didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism leashes down on Mr. Trump while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign on falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestion would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said the Russians had to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said "Of course, I thought that sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defecting the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump adopted an even more plausible tone, as its cargo flows continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a major advance in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and head-to-head races in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally tempted to not excuse himself for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable position to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements might be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent people, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's statement whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-banks, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister, allowed ISIS to spread out by taking control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of backsliding on each of his words and being taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "televisions who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a flavorful café in Williamsburg, where you could pay cash that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices of his Bedford Avenue store front were displaced.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie shop, set up in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, except the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, it is also a new discovery.</seg>
<seg id="8">A reanimated Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new outside station, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnias like capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural tears.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his climb to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicatessen of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "" "said Jane Ziegelman." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes's latest book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while brick was told in her book "97 Orchard" about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest co-operation, "A decent meal," which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They show culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snuchy snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixes.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hammering, this found the couple suitable for discussing the food during the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Brickman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and Bohnenbrot.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper, which extends the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have been in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You Can Eat Buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Crews of women cooked for male Fellows and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "shows the ways the country was moving with it no longer to be the land of shame." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense theme," "" "replied Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was also tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserolle as a "wonderful way to recycle food residue," Brickman noted, as chefs were able to hide unsavory ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the focus of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unique blends have been tried, as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction takes precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman made a dish of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "Ziegelman continues:" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the family business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before, or since then, budget economics - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - has derailed the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housewives" and the challenge to transform pamphlets such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historical delicacies." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-Cake-Eating attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen, he feeds like the million-million man of the world he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated pantry and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully alien to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor would have asked him to take an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in taste establishments by Ms Roosevelt added that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, deal with food, was discarded once the country came back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Brickman, as well as on how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple began to understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of the waste of food," "" "said Coe." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "Ziegelman remembered:" "" "you made people sick." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the fall of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were dispatched at Eisenberg's, they and Coe brought forth a dessert that they had cooked at home: the pledge recipe that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it's called Prune Whip," "" "said Brickman, adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a fancy name." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone dipped somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the tough, brown glibbers.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly, it tasted not bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">CoE picked up three times a night.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hairs usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haired only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims down at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it reaches it, the five meter long animal will accelerate at a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle characterized by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland-shark, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "Alexander Scheuerchen comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, the evolutionary biologist has long assumed that Greenland hairs become stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland hairs are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius, they mostly appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hairs.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion was, as they pointed out six animals in front of Spitsbergen, with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadavers that torment from higher water-layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-arks, who fisher between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest Hai was just 81 cm long, while the biggest shark was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens originates from the birth of the sharks, the proteins in it will no longer be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a strikingly high carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons attempted to spill large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres in length, the core of the lens, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all larger Greenland hairs had normal carbon-14-quantities in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter-long Greenland-shark while the record-shark with 502 centimetres is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature with 392 centimetres and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland haired with the increase obviously had at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the Evolutionbiologist Scheuerchen." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources rather into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Haigerloch: pilgrimage to the Door of Mercy</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministries from the pastoral care unit Eyachting-Haigerloch in St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were accomplished.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the ministries in probably two years, the senior ministerial round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where in this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Greol, and Haze's hole, and holy rooms, set themselves on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor of Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage, and told the Pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">Von Horb was driven by rail to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer loved Lady stood and so the Pilgrimage was trampled from the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual daily tours were framed in the morning and evening by a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way the Minis started to sing again and again on field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For overnight stays, the parish homes of the local parishes were at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage enziele Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and the breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first we had to absolve some 500 metres of altitude and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the evening, the deserved reward was a common barbecue on the badge.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg on the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Minis were visibly relieved and happily arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks to God.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination by Cooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the metropolis of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's racing Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. he proudly made the legend when he stormed home to win a victory from New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they scored only a modest sixth place at the London train world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy siashed - and Skinner prevailed in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders prevailed in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was slightly back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, moving in a higher gear in order to slow down and to enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and dropped out Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they got on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympia chord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kenny's and Hoys side, Hinder admitted that he fell on track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal by England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels like London with all the UK flags on the tribune." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy who was also born on March 23 (apparently a sacred date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny next takes part in the sprint that will start today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had contested with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong web team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing reproaches as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in velodrome, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which at the perfect moment has reached its climax, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy imposed for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 workstations in the complex of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk in case of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the smelting consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>

<seg id="9">The melee of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closing.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, and went to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), spooky reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché-haired action of almost every birthday party of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?"), with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning, but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister, Kim, likes her what the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine, the output is attracting a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertisers from the 832 pages of the RPG 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover stars is eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine seeping through before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities that are modeled" "" "as" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to denominators).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world has always been tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, she called them "the misty pieces of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings turned up again when the news came out with the release of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around the grievousness seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably once populated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had Earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere and still spun slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus increases its daybed side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates thick layers of clouds, which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously assumed by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen withdrew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, which we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in star-pile to different rates as well as in which connection the rotational periods are associated with the planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these ripening stars come up with large amounts of star winches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have an braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars more slow pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," says Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the cluster of the plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still a lot to find out about how, when and why stars decelerate their rotational rates and hang up their "dance shoes" so to speak.</seg>

<seg id="2">Catch: due to a positive doping test, Weightlifeber Adrian Zielinski from Poland won't be allowed to start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A knowledgeable athlete would have gained almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases became known as the Rio de Janeiro "Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, Zilwia Dankova from Bulgaria and Polish Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the CAS International Sports Court confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have been able to participate in the courses over 50 m of Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B Trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and demands from Chen full cooperation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news permeated the positive test at Daniowa, the 33-year-old went on its own offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT." ""</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, the ban on the ban on blood doping may be EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Daniova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov promptly announced his criticism of the people of the world.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, the Dankova case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Association had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic doping, including the nation of Kenya producing numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, in the swimming sport, the earlier links in China also ensured intense confrontations between the athletes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data-lau: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer of blackmail malware uses targeted companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Malwareytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software, according to the Malaysian observations, to attack corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to reimburse ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarterhofer-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attaches took place in the past few months quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches deliberately for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackpresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of bitcoin cryptograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ransomware is added.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt their business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will regain their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of downtimes in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure explored the user interfaces and contact with blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You tell their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate very hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from Ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackpresser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The latest malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware themselves, offering advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price of $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is a tool for adjustment so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaids then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and mandates another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with spreading," "" "Wisniewski explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now well-known among many companies that better back up their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the malwarterytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful blackmail, the perpetrators will instead threaten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," "" "explains Malwartergabytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also completely new targets in the internet of things to the grain in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the CO Conference on Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could control a thermostat associated with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off there.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded like chin-chairs and thus offer storage space that is 1,24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded easily, however, the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should however perform his work somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>

<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI connector are located beneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>

<seg id="2">It regularly stalls on the road - here a picture of November.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, and in the morning you can no longer think of sleep long before the bell rings.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of the adults have sleep problems and more than ten percent sense their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can cause a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the insomnia, therefore an one- and through-sleep-disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just going through sleep many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleeping disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in case of depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are dependent on one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc incident can be bad, wake up every two or three hours and possibly start saluting about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbance become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is adversely affected by the day should visit the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: you are beaten down, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are hardly any psychotherapists in Germany, emphasizing Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory medical centre at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems, advises her.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in case of snoring with respiratory dropouts, physicians advise doctors to study in the sleep laboratory, for diseases of the daily fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the disguise you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014 he took gold for the first time at the world championships in Doha and at the same time set his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-Athlete Markus Deibler via Facebook has protested against his ex-team-mates who are under criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 €bonus and a jungle king 150,000 euros, nobody should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page at night on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of liner brooks, and a rest of cobblestones in between: the Rīga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain serves at first sight, but the police belong to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one walks along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a beer shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is supposed to be demolished soon, it is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain refers, however, will be favored in recent weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the tenants have rented lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel has spoken out several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been evacuated by 300 police officers, patrolling the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and refrained from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children, are mainly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "it doesn't sound like a" "" "Kiez" "" "who wished for several local police protection against the vandals left." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin internatator and the police force between home occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to the rest of the city, Friedrichshain in East Berlin was in fact a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police supplies in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world: with them residents of GDR times and former home-occupied residents share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognisable from invoked panes or freshly painted facades that have been cast with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often as" "" "left autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crime like body injury is, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make property damage, which tend to meet newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years beside the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is appeasingly: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer there anymore in the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal, on the contrary: "here, one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately dragged into the Rīga Street.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also so important that the residents get back their road: from the police, politicians and the media, which in July all of a sudden claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which supplant the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums, which are not interesting for many - rather people who are not so well betrothed," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those who are fond of color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub, can complain bad about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons introduced only with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee trader</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the Refugee Commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working groups for refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customers from the working group indicate that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the sworn Wollmilksau, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mocking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative specialist was looked for with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an egg-cutting wool milkessow.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been doing this for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports both honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstrasse</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the council office to the commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it doesn't work so far as to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be chastened as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstrasse.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "perspective is the keyword, Regine's customer and Annika Deuschle agree." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, training centres, schoolyards, one-euro jobs and outreach for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive exterior effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here are administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling at some point can't help in Urbach, do not work and be useless, it will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also problems," "" "says the customer," "" "People who do nothing at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach, after the recent incidents?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer says quite clearly," "" "what some may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins were summoning them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants should soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors themselves.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to provide them with helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbach are already busy integrating the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
