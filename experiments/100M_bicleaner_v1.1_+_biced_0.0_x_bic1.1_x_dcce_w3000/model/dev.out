Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
the meeting should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal promoted by Obama to the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship of the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech that was part of an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken to with Obama , a meeting with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel was rejected .
in an emergency call Professor decides to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told a somewhat timi@@ d voice from the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably ag@@ itated , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was written on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ vot@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ camp@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sub@@ merged in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who commen@@ ded Lamb , said he also seemed a little upset and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously requested the Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for whom Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ b &apos;s track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb roasted himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner methane Johnson said .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he did a doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time , he was the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both appearing on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica playing before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the vi@@ gil , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call when he shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plan to hire less man@@ power for the holiday season
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but Toy and Baby products dealers say he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season of 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is increasing from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees that sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox ch@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it is gradually clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it seems to me that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and a wavel@@ ength of being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon tells Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief once again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks at p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the odds of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp would probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom also won a state in the Nom@@ ination Process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of ten re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week stated that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp@@ s Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive comments , 52 percent of Irish voters being ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election nation , I@@ owa State , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to execute his office effectively , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their g@@ ob@@ lins , Republi@@ can vot@@ er Tru@@ mp believe in real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination most likely , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey from last week , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that is a change since the time four of ten at the end of July put their money back to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the final cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters reject Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans had gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp almost beat everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey from Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority of support .
he has prior to C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they made their minds .
a new pol@@ l by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have won their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say that you never change your mind .
46 percent said they let the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp was called &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ v@@ ot point in the public discourse became 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic phr@@ ase@@ ology of Tru@@ mp will keep Hiz@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and humili@@ ate the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration is in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems to do Donald Tru@@ mp also .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs on new levels .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for around half the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Americans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans at Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a flat roof building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is limited naturally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double cake in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have donated a dream start to the FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her play in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympics in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starter success in series shall be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
at his 28th place in the Champions League , Müller was rewarded with the help of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who let the world champion &apos;s thought out as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern captain Philipp L@@ ahm , before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept the word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bol@@ dly , but in their aggressive efforts they often went to pieces .
the attacks were often introduced by game shift to left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i &apos;s former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k penet@@ rated from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer , Ide@@ ye Brown smote the head ball of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct dial , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ting with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had asc@@ ended their usual playing game , Pi@@ raeus could put needle @-@ stick @-@ stit@@ ches .
on Tor@@ guard Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was forgiveness .
so , for example , when he directed a shot of ideas on the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of him , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Go@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter he added another one .
before the game , it was in the sta@@ dion to Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly disper@@ sed Bavarian fans apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went on strike against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bavarian @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke are not only har@@ med by the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term , long @-@ term study .
good news : at ren@@ unciation the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth loss are decay and inflammation of the gum , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent g@@ ums in smo@@ kers .
however , it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk , however , within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could last for more than ten years before the threat to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers was lowered , Thomas Dietrich declared by the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained investig@@ ator H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health down to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness have been affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early loss of teeth .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come across the banks of Cologne on rem@@ nants of late Anti@@ quity
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ nants of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a department of archaeological land conservation .
in the third part of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists were now five .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new court dispute in dispute
to mitig@@ ate the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP is planned to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are specifically envis@@ aged that the EU states and the United States will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time it is also provided for a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
until now , the participants agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgments .
in the recent months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own information .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded especially by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel adjustment , on which companies can strike damage to tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to Canada &apos;s already negotiated free trade agreement ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered key points in the reform that Sig@@ mar Gabriel , Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE business association warned against limiting the opportunities for the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged in this way .
when the talks on the Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sat on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting fol@@ k@@ singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks about various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ osity and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative mad@@ man .
with 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously closely with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift in great opul@@ ent any time .
rum@@ or has it that Mich@@ igan would be the first part of a series of we@@ eds : each of the 50 U.S. states should be followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and anticip@@ ates certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
he live with guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a highly polished masterpiece appears in 2005 .
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is not in any record list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic compositions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth regular studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried out by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
long ago , the smaller clubs got up , the stage shows here are a colorful spectacle from ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , which has become much more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in essence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only one en@@ core thank@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bly , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce will be eag@@ erly awaited
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ces and for the first time set up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre @-@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the celebration of the National An@@ them at a commemor@@ ative celebration on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several title stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in dis@@ respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of Shadow mini@@ atures have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences follow Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limits on profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour should make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who has since become T@@ ory boss over the last decade across the dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another politi@@ cian , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 inspiration .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refrain from serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , will represent him if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is traveling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch P@@ unch &quot; which was often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ aire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling and its leadership in the House of Represent@@ atives , even though critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires extensive reforms .

pound climbs through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound was spr@@ inging up according to data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and provided assessment since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound went up by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after Tak@@ eover Off@@ er of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competi@@ tor group for luxury goods ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the Mon@@ di packaging and paper company were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had placed his assessment for the firm rating on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sell &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports states that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs in his company , he says .
the cost could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Justi@@ n yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .

he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 .
be@@ aver himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t really interest the many zer@@ os .
at least he does .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings Lebanese to the idea of a potato dum@@ my idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
these are both - in the potato cor@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ as@@ ant owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sauce has been added in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been registered with the Munich Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as utility model according to the authorities .
Al@@ hay therefore does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes are the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding comes along well with his customers .
Met@@ a starts soil policy campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - ein@@ zur@@ es
Met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A branch off an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A shops and store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and devices conduc@@ ts its annual investors strategy day .
there is a lot in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ a &apos;s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to roughly 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut away around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take off all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 million turnover per year and met@@ a 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the amounts on met@@ a @-@ high fixed costs based on met@@ a could cost some 13 million dollars earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan fi@@ gured that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ a &apos;s turnover in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , talked about a business lunch in Melbourne , that Met@@ abol@@ ism will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ a will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass received contact last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies around 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to reach sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products each week and to improve IG@@ A retailers to improve their stores by growing fresh gro@@ c@@ eries and delivering a better choice of private label food .
Met@@ a &apos;s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop renovation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick C@@ yrene and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour , according to the president of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is often referred to as Special K@@ s , got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the not@@ orious confrontation of C@@ yrene with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; wr@@ in@@ ka could have beat C@@ yrene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp sh@@ ook a potential US Open @-@ win victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I get quite busy is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost the US Open because of a cr@@ amp but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider C@@ yrene in the important decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common choice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; C@@ yrene &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has quickly made the rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time out of the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the state of emergency and sealed off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants trapped in a No Man &apos;s land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ stration got up .
when a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; opening the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts to the Hungarian police police .
some expelled food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border met a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc in a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crow@@ ed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after all , the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would take up another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a soon @-@ going action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency stand@@ still inaugurated on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , stated that his country would also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most emerging economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia is a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation resulting from mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the military deployment of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities killed 45 people in trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences under the new laws .
authorities are in the process of spe@@ edi@@ ly re@@ pairing the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the border had arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to crowd out there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important auto@@ bahn @-@ connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ ander is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the voters of the elections .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a major advance in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for men has s@@ unk significantly , and S@@ anders only returns with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the voters of the elections would say nationwide that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are most enthusiastic about her .
the views are bl@@ ended with those who currently do not support Clinton , only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned in their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also cited .
as the Vice @-@ President throws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders has increased from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twenty @-@ five percent of voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , democracy voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters will be unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some key features in voters in the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not agree with him .
in general , the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions to H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server remain as foreign ministers during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not affected their views altogether .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
they are mostly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters will also see Tru@@ mp as not tru@@ thful and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , maintain good marks in leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than be honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son advances in nationwide survey close to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son resi@@ des in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
on the two candidates , half of the voters support in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers . support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey showed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins governor Scott Walker , who has fallen the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former governor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place with 6 % .
the fault margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son advances in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support for the re@@ public@@ ans behind the mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tru@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a I@@ owa campaign .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing tourists is enough to find even warm water .
a bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go into the sea any more : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) communic@@ ates with them .
in contrast , bathing temperatures still offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the East , it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a bul@@ ky ritual of a student loyalty in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , condemned the police .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ ded eyes with a 30 pound ster@@ sack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to pass over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Society did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and supposedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle their symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and basically posed the welfare of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Police Chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the following morning on his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to his head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the budget will be sha@@ ken ; returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US Federal Reserve have stressed so v@@ ehem@@ ently that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather to the period needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement because of an increase in interest could possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy might be able to react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be cancelled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average return in previous six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , Head of Plant Strate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return is starting to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not exist before and which might accelerate recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a price increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 gross price increases since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants were prepared all year for the increase of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could hold an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading would only have a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP growth and rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far these are 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le because the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic direction .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease takes place in the cycle .
at the end of the increases cycle , the loans return immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jones states that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has wi@@ dened , and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy .
in large and large corporations , which cover the greater part of their business in the US , profit from them when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after initial interest increase , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher income , even if experts from different opinions are , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mu@@ til@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ mate Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins asser@@ ted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into Classic FM , claiming a leading Member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; desp@@ aired &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously @-@ named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I think really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder on the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not very distinctive ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; produced in a special way &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he would like the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee contribut@@ or to other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are signs that online sales are now stagn@@ ating after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales will stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian sales journal .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some tra@@ der websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday in which buyers fought for bar@@ gains could prevent buyers from doing purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that a little more than £ 1 was spent online of £ 5 .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia att@@ aches to the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims assembled , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the stretch to pay their respect when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ malign@@ ant cemetery .
the funeral procession passed on to the sacred site , where only days before a building crane fell through the mosque &apos;s ceiling and then on the sin@@ king .
the corp@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king hung a san@@ ction on the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the corp@@ ses of 29 persons who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane under@@ mined .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the p@@ add@@ ling to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today king Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not tell this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad were prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the great mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the bin Laden group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also added the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi dy@@ nasty of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apo@@ state son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government representatives ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other los@@ ers receive half of this amount .

Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops offering professional tra@@ des@@ people and 60 retail outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that have more women single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British index listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has staff@@ ed 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group re@@ charged the cost of closing the shops .
King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , has 200 new stores due to the trend .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball team leader A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion at the Kla@@ gen@@ furt Regional Court .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this alle@@ gation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 used funds from club accounts , which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
this fact was the Chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ vel Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the dis@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time the association had ar@@ isen as an asset .
the sports officials only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 € ) .
&quot; at that time , we were facing the situation : do we continue or block the club , &quot; told one of the accused , in the bread@@ form of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the finance ministry .
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made money , our life insur@@ ances have been put down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to pay any debts .
furthermore , in the case of financial success , the payout of the expense allowance had been approved retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , a portion of the allowance was paid only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detail deviations seemed to appear , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us led@@ gers managed the two defend@@ ants in common , said the second accused .
why the out@@ payments were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
the association did not interest itself in the details of the financial geb@@ ar@@ ung , it was important to have only the liberty of debt , so the answer .
when in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigation , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account was on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
on top of that , the first defend@@ ant declared that he was not in agreement with this formulation , because the association had never been har@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a proxy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the function@@ ary said moreover , he never purchased a c@@ ents salary , he merely calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and diets .
on diets , he charged the Club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not show accurate records for the early years .
these were , after an operation test , in which everything had been judged correctly , they were no longer kept , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also covered the mil@@ eage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the exercises were in cash , for that he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his home town to the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard bl@@ ends more 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts that have been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will disman@@ tle further jobs during the spl@@ itting of the company .
the sub@@ missions in the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
within the scope of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the amount of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs should be saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs that has been running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
on the same time , the Hewlett @-@ Packard stock was 2.3 percent .
the corporation headquartered with printers from California Pal@@ o Alto is currently spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once more dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , last changed to the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer in the world .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under US $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more stores online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total breakdown of approximately 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , mainly come against rejection : 54 percent said about it , 35 percent were appro@@ ving .
that other states are flying air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .

&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence outbreak in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police were deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ thro@@ wers against several hundred deplo@@ y@@ ments .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence outbreak at the border control point .

behind the police there was a police line and behind the polic@@ emen a water thro@@ wer was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially deployed un@@ interrupted Pfe@@ ffer@@ spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drew somewhat cau@@ ti@@ ously .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas shri@@ ve .

time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make an important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade , interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view , was that the F@@ ed would do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the present level will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may possibly leave the null zone and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to balance and generate only low inflation .
however , F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global relations .
it warned the markets to stop up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death schüt@@ z at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies for cancellation
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on a man and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give an explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb took 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb took his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his life lu@@ ke@@ warm on the University &apos;s website .

in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1,000 executives will cost the work of the Group .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa construc@@ ts its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to contribute a profit contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and earnings syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the board for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings &quot; low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
in future , in the board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tari@@ ff conflict with the cockpit Association cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the strike in court on this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this divided the union .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted reference result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted to achieve yiel@@ ding results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the provision of the pilot , the background is the spar@@ es concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that Lufthansa moves to the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings competition in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of dup@@ lication
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left foreign def@@ enders to cry and won him off for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double b@@ room and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , has a hard time and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it will take six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ rom@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ f@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the UK distributor has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico was playing against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very hard , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so that it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .

surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message we have missed . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead giving a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; among the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron now reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , as the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees f@@ ading , thri@@ ll frustr@@ ating once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who didn &apos;t read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , there is no repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat on my map .
I would not finish one @-@ out victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown quantity on test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - players are their own best choices .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th had been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test hit gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only repro@@ ach one could claim was that England first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist I highly appreciate .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as they get ahead of him , but this obviously depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to hit mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would produce an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , turned up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s sco@@ oter of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he immediately made three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in harmony with the aforementioned .
Coll@@ y &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot earned a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not specify the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy hearted .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy enters a dol@@ drums by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s unprecedented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought viol@@ ently for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states are deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always of its own debt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a picture of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exc@@ essively long @-@ lasting res@@ ins such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that is why some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s 2017 presidential campaign to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost , and what kind of EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press scene , as it did during the 1975 referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can feel weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ber ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseudo @-@ nation@@ als most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but realized that when one sits in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly sw@@ aps on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ Sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I really express it - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild bra@@ ins of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ m@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , aber kein Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ uties according to all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the ag@@ it@@ ant bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allows him to maintain labs support in the speech campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks safe .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C won &apos;t have a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the start of Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in their report on e cigar@@ ettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Reference Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the statement of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people called to develop a multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis ( MC@@ DA ) decision to make their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting members of the board will not be delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the damage of most products on most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alle@@ gations of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison with the tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease with reference to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clear evidence of recent evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ erly , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ erly and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ fought time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC CEO , Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also be clearly demonstrated by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee in his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fees , what I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others don &apos;t do or commissioned .
they send The Voice to a first class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ erly is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arms for it .
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC anyway .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for assessments because of the ambition of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comment@@ aries on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will again show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart L@@ ecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows should sell as East@@ erly .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal &quot; N@@ ic programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Committee on the broad@@ caster : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think , we all think you get a great value here for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its ethics mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production was officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain the public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful on television will be shown , and with the commercial tran@@ smit@@ ters Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the switch @-@ on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically altered to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
flat@@ worms generally do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , it found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani has genetically engineered the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels carry .
when applying ultras@@ oun@@ ds to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the altered mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which must be sent down to the desired point in the brain with optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms fair - by a Le@@ erst@@ el of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic oscill@@ ating corporate advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the inv@@ ading with bright colours and animation it remains more durable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Res@@ idents
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ made 19 year old , I moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly irrit@@ ating to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you get , whether and where you have taken sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those you would not talk to even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people go .
people often turn into beverage recipes , movie night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress and watch their under@@ wear .
related : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted is a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away to return the energy I have spent on interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is tired of convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of the kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcoming of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked something for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people falling asleep when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling your food is a common crime in student residence halls .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbors , whether it is something for them to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would move into the same student residence by chance ?
conver@@ sely , if you have a room@@ mate for your future spouse , she would have to go to her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps see how she travels all together ?
of course the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk a little reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good punch is funny , but it takes only moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not cr@@ ush their hol@@ dings on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building row houses for people who do not have much money in Central Fran@@ con@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need dormit@@ ories , but also the alone educ@@ ating mother and the young ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can still build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly a living space can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great deal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees we need ample living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row of terra@@ ced houses needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when you teach people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : legally , I have carried out my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking space ordin@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still subordin@@ ate who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their travel @-@ house project ?
Gil@@ es : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need room space .
not only refugees but also the single mothers and the ear@@ ners .
I would like to show you still cheap and well @-@ built today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone Operating System when Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message stating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to wait before the attack goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by linking the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process has been completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch to half way and this might lead to break@@ age of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for World Cup title N@@ ico Ros@@ berg against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg has only one motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup 2nd emphasized before the start into the decisive seven Over@@ seas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve races so far and is also launching the Fl@@ ut@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member in its ranks , thus the number of members increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who took over 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen for the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , who accepted Alfred Klein .
thus it is possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent research should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the Schach@@ club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiss &quot; is seen as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the retirement centre Anton@@ isti@@ s have joined the social foundation under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation dra@@ gs it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new headquarters was recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , senior citizens and advice for advice from now on receive information on issues such as the care insurance or services of the health and care companies .
for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nur@@ ses are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many insurance services are not rarely used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the public hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ s@@ Office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the retirement centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis perfectly complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in the demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ ch@@ office dedic@@ ates himself to the association at age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thereby the Social Foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the qu@@ arti@@ ce office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5th September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus am Tuesday announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus loos@@ es an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the re@@ building of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it from the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beat a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghanistan
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 pm , three young men were on the way to Sal@@ mün@@ ster on foot from Bad So@@ den .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed with the police to his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young man and hit his face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al her@@ nia and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed there several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
with the help of a head@@ stock , one applied to the face and the th@@ igh of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only a vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator &apos;s description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket should have been around 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller to acquire field breaks and invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ erer .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ im U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert also appreci@@ ates this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still half@@ way home in the next few months .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he is investing 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ u@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing their medical training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash cans would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ erer and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mil@@ ler liked the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bin bought the house with practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and volunte@@ ered to participate in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ deg@@ ast works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both intern@@ s , want to settle down as hous@@ em@@ akers .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and do not need a speaking room anymore .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 euros as part of a funding programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ bapti@@ st Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the practice field breaks every quarter , in North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ erer .
if no successor could have been found , it would have gone .
those who visit mil@@ ler &apos;s consultation hours , by the way , still look mainly in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical professionals practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ deg@@ ast re@@ members sm@@ iles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , she feels a little melanchol@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are living further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband laugh@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always been in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also being carried out at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany and also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly checked as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister emphas@@ ised , Slovenia would not like to block its borders for refugees however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles continue to meet new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Alban@@ ian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously mig@@ rated migrants to the Hungarian border , would agree on the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government , however , denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; he said .
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were traveling all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometers away through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard Hungary done so we told the police that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could indeed lead to a further west @-@ west@@ ward route to the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said earlier that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not call details , but he pointed out that , as a non @-@ Schengen member , Croatia was &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently made a good report to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der &apos;s reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees will now travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm down on Wednesday early in a local evi@@ ction in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debate on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee figures at present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatia war still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians to pay $ 30 million
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of getting an insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information collected , insi@@ der shops on the financial markets should have been made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SE@@ C statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the case lasted .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are said to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has been existing for 20 years

&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life at stunning autumn sunlight and in the middle of it four large plates each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I &apos;d like .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid draws attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously grab the chal@@ k and read the proposition around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I make it clear that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the Director of the Mannheim Di@@ ak@@ onian Work , which is working together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid .
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the theme of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people .
an assessment that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning accompan@@ ist is among the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was sought by the Appe@@ als Office , she immediately reported that she was present at the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - accompanied by relatives and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and the experiences and experiences he has made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning companions .
training is offered every two years for new employees .
the boards on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .

the lower prospect is despite the price increases that are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will take effect on January 4 and despite higher allow@@ ances for body transport of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November .
the company said that it was nonetheless expected that the result would increase in comparison to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields if you consider the weaker as anticipated economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts at Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit Express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales of body transport rose by 29 per cent , but the operating result was mainly flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labor costs in freight business .
in the market trading , about one hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most awaited conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time for almost a decade .
facing them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from the Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the Great Rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most econom@@ ists show that it is growing soli@@ dly , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and is it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at Mak@@ ler@@ a Sti@@ fel , Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es itself to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mitig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial grade dropped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy sustain@@ s the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , lest she panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in a good way to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen were told in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expecting .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases showed signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would ch@@ urn the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when the interest is to increase .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lining , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank .
now he says that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describes the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be taken into account in terms of technical decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere reference to Ben S. Bern@@ anke , then , in the year 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow its monetary expansion , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently do not relate to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to increase interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives cancelled the cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Gover@@ ning of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she fears a rise in interest , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome , not without the dedication of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 songs .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers home on the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , it &apos;s a different lesson than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric company Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to sho@@ cking women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding time . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building proposal for the € 2.3 million expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ site are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session the elabor@@ ated construction application has been unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee had , among other things , decided on an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal exemp@@ tion from a valid cultivation plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ m@@ apped first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; again , it was about the pitch of the roof , which is stipulated by energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - to lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the planning plan on the roof reluct@@ ance permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby Bern@@ rie@@ der Commun@@ der@@ at usually proceeds more restric@@ tively with deliver@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in gymn@@ asti@@ cs , however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the cost is approximately 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected from school and l@@ atitude promotion .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the State Council for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed land@@ lady Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
the staff were informed of the plans .
Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has recently been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital since the beginning of the year , has now replaced a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this yields in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases at the In@@ ner Station .
for the next two years Fischer will be with his team , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves the two houses , until then next year the former hospital of the n@@ app@@ y , which has 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed .
Land@@ tra@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the federal government , should in future be used as accommodation for asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss was unable to say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a conference @-@ psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ moving of Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years has not given it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au colleagues to take over the post of Doctor &apos;s Director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in the past decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , but there is no excuse for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season the ba@@ thers moved into a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and made some goo@@ dies there .
hunting accident with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action , as the police announced .
after firing a fire , a man of 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
at first it was not clear how it could happen to the accident .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ ef@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ ef@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police ran on Wednesday .
as a suspi@@ cious one , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , captured on Tuesday evening , is also deemed to have been admitted and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the body .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ ef@@ ausen had not come home as agreed .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in the event of inter@@ ro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tances of the missing person , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ ef@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the respon@@ dent reported to the authorities in the police inter@@ ro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and laid the corp@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the o@@ at on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead end to him .

refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are also seeking a affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution battle on the German housing market has long since begun .
with incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association debate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
there@@ with 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an accommodation facility .
many come across the housing market and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study also makes significant savings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is moving an apartment deficit that will grow from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently around 70@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compla@@ ins , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of need in shared flat areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ willing to stay at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the loud noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing construction .
this way , the real estate tax would be dispens@@ ed with and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended .
furthermore , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters by the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available EUR 300 million had already been raised on Monday evening .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia address corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no escape to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose to travel across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian broad@@ cast@@ ers RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws which came into force on the same day also virtually eliminate ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately upon arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across border f@@ ences .
the border strip contains other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border there are hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before closing on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stipul@@ ate the overcoming and damaging of the border zone as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned dro@@ ught pen@@ alties up to five years and the expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees had taken up there .
practically nobody has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
lat@@ ti@@ ces were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government instructions .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the journey to Germany .
the railway traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , small groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor passed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge ceremony on Sunday we were busy with the ti@@ dy when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance to the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drove the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we had the unexpected guests su@@ c@@ cul@@ ated only once , with a snack and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , in order to try again on the border after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany .
the regional train was completed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbors was soci@@ able on Sunday , Sunday before a two @-@ bridge course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help establish structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has publicly and publicly accepted the attitude of the Hungarian government into the sphere of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the refugees will find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter , to establish decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ fixed quarters
Konrad tried to do all his hands with the support of the refugee .
Christian Konrad used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to set up districts for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first reception centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without a big f@@ uss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke about a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 districts last year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no grass without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial cent@@ uri@@ ons .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also has great expectations in the ORF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ORF . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it may not be that qu@@ arti@@ ers have to observe a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , that he was more successful when he was lod@@ ged , Konrad himself based his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t inc@@ ur any costs for the republic , as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far the search for a quarter has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since it is possible to support those affected without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other locations should be checked for their suitability .
the city boss critic@@ ises the distribution of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced the further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
however , those seeking refuge would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now taking control of its borders again is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the line of liners is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; T has entered four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be let out to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies of the new ship@@ yard and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro 1.7 million invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
actually Jutta had wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner from Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now gained new growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop concerning the business in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets have to have from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a store again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a dedicated site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has brought Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I exchange the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women wearing a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can &apos;t answer the house@@ wife with last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ enco@@ ders .
this property also ties some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it mani@@ fests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalist looking or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office boo@@ sts the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well with it .
this is also recorded in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ish@@ fr@@ is@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term known to many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to it over -@@ zig @-@ corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but aren &apos;t so impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters Art , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , including Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks a word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly succeed if he was living in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit a major mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally lu@@ te the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in high German : the initi@@ ator , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the l@@ ender .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group was the first real estate in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy . their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as well as the Polish , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant k@@ mp of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ son was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Win@@ ner in retirement sees the American rather distant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm mentioned how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mentioned that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz during a visit ended up something for the church organ , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , who has been inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , has seen 12 000 movie @-@ singers , also in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the position of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull reached the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five main cities , in comparison with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has been closed .
in August Today , Today , Today , Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 were compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 was achieved .
until now , Sun@@ rise is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today with an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the original series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could perform a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , showed 44@@ ,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour the audience reached 7@@ 20,000 .
average 6@@ 20,000 Hot @-@ Se@@ at .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for one million dollars that failed to over@@ take Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : b@@ achel@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood eventually lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why wood is the perfect man and thus called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be their partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become the per@@ ni@@ cious player who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as pairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m .

Jar@@ ry d Hay@@ nes had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League converter at his first hit return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and even in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a publicly supported Hay@@ nes in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his rap@@ ed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry d Hay@@ nes p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first match of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy at 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ den compared the car@@ ver with his original debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ nes posed for a photo with fans and keeps an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ ag@@ ram .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters are calling for the employment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Fall clause in the city of Bavaria before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were not according to new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get worship in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parliament survey of the Free elec@@ torate conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
in fact , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the creation of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts in charge of asylum law@@ suits : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern p@@ utt@@ eth away , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more hand@@ some . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the national policies in the city of Groß@@ wall@@ stadt do not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a long lasting torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; middle @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 high schools in which an extension of the secondary high @-@ level secondary school from three to four years is being tested .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 People killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Gover@@ nor , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside of a police station , some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known from the fact that they can kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ onn@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the arus that want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been engaged in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been central for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the leg@@ is@@ lators voted on certain cl@@ auses this week in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the grounds at the Em@@ de Youth Centre Alte Post are to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the commerci@@ alisation of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Old Post youth centre .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
waiting for appropriate offers , it is called the city .
which investor may come into question is not yet clear .
however , no agreements have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner big street , already a few months ago and the building was demol@@ ished .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ gli@@ men are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure jurisdiction
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , gr@@ asp@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
for months , the project , which is worth ten to twelve million euros , has been in discussion since months .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ den@@ ers , who had come to the meeting , brought the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , member of the sea and board member representing the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cla@@ d that overlooks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like many other project critics that the traffic would increase by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be full bus inv@@ itations , so that this is worth it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints were still variable .

Google launches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling campaign aimed at sending $ 11 million to humanitarian organisations that are to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the don@@ ate call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to goo@@ gle@@ .com / a total of $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which enrolled an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have been collecting in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I under those who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical di@@ ab@@ etic treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was completely dis@@ b@@ anded and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dis@@ b@@ anded only at one percent and only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better with the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , according to Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that currently attracts attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not accommodate all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East could lie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide asked for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics .
he demanded that under given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long term solutions such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he did violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four@@ fold increase of intake of dis@@ infection by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that swallow strong alcoholic san@@ iti@@ zer , &quot; says Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age climbed the po@@ ison@@ ous control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ infection intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents allegedly have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 broad@@ caster in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry du@@ ck@@ ling disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally considered to be dr@@ unken in an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sang her words and was unable to go as she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head , &quot; Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcohol products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by suggest@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reported a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

the lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ Middle @-@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm Games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ or to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the ensu@@ ing departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now has five points ahead , is clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like this - but we have to go on .
we really need the support from Celtic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

the players coming in the summer have this high season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Hear@@ ts dis@@ continued on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later repe@@ aled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ co@@ aster

the incident happened in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh to a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ n@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; it is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ n@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Management Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will put the guys back on their toes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive League victory , which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ m in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues that won &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it continues to rise .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the average of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the interim , employment in Scotland was around 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch a man be put to death .
if it happens and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the USA , and since more applications than places are available , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery is held in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters whom you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man after a wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to leave the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him gently to go back to the shore . &quot;
cann@@ ing V@@ ale Police was called into pel@@ vic surgery on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to float across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals were inspired by the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to stop racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity , claiming that they conducted a personal campaign against him with L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ i for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cob@@ alt cru@@ x test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months for the sp@@ ying repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ handed grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have anything to say about it and I &apos;ve sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you respond and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to go about the head raised , and I want my owners to think I &apos;m doing my best for them .
when they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that M@@ oo@@ dy had had the bomb explo@@ ding in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart stayed in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me to the point of view that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and perhaps makes people out of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and break away , and I have no doubt that what I say , they now think about it .
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debates , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy proposes against ri@@ vals because of alle@@ gations of ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy comments on the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the Storm @-@ Player &quot; ring fighting &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ sted remark on the Storm team after his team claimed the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the ts@@ un@@ ami of his team and said they were concentrating only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team makes him feel confident because it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is repeated over and over again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring@@ ing when they fought against us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real centre of gravity , and this has provided us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this time of year appears again and again .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a dirty trick .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co vs. Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will encounter them in one phase .
the Storm team released on this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday evening at the final final at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug submission
a man who could potentially have a life sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and settled in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday .
at the case of the case , he told the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a $ 200,000 deposit as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he dis@@ covers his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , reports daily with the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks took office in the direction of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noted it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone by girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used concepts to search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor Mr E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ct - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him , but he said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , having taken in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the requirements and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked for H@@ og@@ g not to appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict from October to October in order to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
floo@@ ders switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the traffi@@ ckers were frigh@@ tened of the discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the border river Inn in the districts Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and du@@ st@@ les to the German side .
there they are received by the Federal Police Office and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the start of the week , the Munich Central Station met again significantly more refugees in comparison to the start of the week .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 : 00 and said a speaker in the morning .
following the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area above Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden in particular .
according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ seek@@ reis with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass is doing it : every two years , the car makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is above all a movement in the compact cars that are currently very well sold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) on this segment alone in August .
this is also reflected in the IAA ( from September 17 to 27 ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new top @-@ class cars and luxury cars .
one of the premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not to be much more expensive .
Opel makes an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view that starts at 17,@@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is now only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will be next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively to be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the new model will be able to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adapts completely to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer , however , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n scra@@ per was first hand on the front part : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was especially moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
at the IAA in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI , were added at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison sentence Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are lod@@ ged in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were detained only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with it , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meter floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , has meanwhile moved to a larger cell , has been transferred to a larger cell .
his detention centre due to the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the Berlin State failed .
however , the judges rendered the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and returned the case back to the trial .
they see man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for the compensation were decisive , there was a compensation claim , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of ground compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they only spoke in April of a prisoner of in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity , because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , un@@ worthy is the multiple occupation of a cell without separate toilet .
moreover , in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing for a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommodated daily between 15 to 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines because of lack of staff .
for this reason , prisoners are always locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even in the case of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , about 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to ger@@ many con@@ veys the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - over the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year , 60,000 to 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rental price , and in order to find these particularly favourable flats they will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing each year would have to be created and therefore the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ising Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission industry , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to th@@ ron@@ gs , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to the recognition of labour .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the duty of residen@@ cy that the asylum seekers have confined to a residence .
in the society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view prevailed that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
until now there is no sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses .
studies also show that workplaces are most often facilit@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the building of networks is the Royal Road to the Integration of Labor according to the view of Engel@@ hardt .
the Berlin School administration stated that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ es , estimated to be ten to 15 percent . &quot; for the parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ zi@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin sen@@ ate administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is increasing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialized schools .
students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in the countries without any knowledge of German .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin School administration .
the Deutscher Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or tolerated studies are forbidden - the only exception has been Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Studi@@ os@@ wil@@ liam@@ entary refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ ce do not receive benefits according to the asylum application law more if they start studying .
the latter , in general , do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the bene@@ fici@@ aries .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far , in order to be entitled to vote , from 1 January 2016 this gap shor@@ tens to 15 months .
but also this financing gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively assign the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state religion relation .
the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association is also important , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also belong to the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the central council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to hide such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent .
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination centre for a decade and a general equality law .
but it is very slowly learning how the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ series showed that the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and public authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant workers and stakeholders of non @-@ sk@@ inn@@ ed Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention Germany ple@@ dge must be a reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medi@@ cally to the refugees that are expected so far , German Medical Director Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacity are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be poured into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand out health cards to all newcom@@ ers .
services rendered could later be bil@@ led with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors make especially the language barriers to create .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical offices , interpre@@ ting costs need to be taken over , she demands .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical start @-@ ups in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and among young people it is about HIV awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with some of the other disease pictures , German doctors are coming from their apprentices@@ hips , but of course , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the medical don@@ or , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have developed a highly developed educational system , some of them are even doctors .
in order to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Bund@@ esp@@ a cho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer from , among other things , the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ burn and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sho@@ el@@ iness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms being chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically sick asylum seekers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the welfare offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social welfare offices , non @-@ personnel or doctors who are not trained for mental illness will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production , the Circus Pro@@ bst vent@@ ures back to the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream on the brick and the v@@ ases .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ er and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for over 33 years .
so the gift of Inspir@@ ing is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take away people from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their handi@@ craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to easily record the Cuban du@@ et .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to inv@@ ade women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ons , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and jo@@ int@@ edness .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
sn@@ ak@@ y people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little else and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are all too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals , neither is it good for us either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the top command therefore : care for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all our hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst charges its performances daily from 17 to 20 September at 17 : 00 p.m .
the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm on Sunday .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animal shelter is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , came down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the case video quickly spread through social media .
the opening of the Parliament has also been comfor@@ ted by alle@@ gations of opposition members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous threats of death and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
in the last month they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Democratic Change Movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity of Parliament ends and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers posed by politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard reaches up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and separate computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected reduction of jobs will result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a statement by the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill , Hewlett Packard , to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely @-@ focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation follows a plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old pe@@ p during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the off@@ ences .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement will last in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to enjoy a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was hit on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson of the past season with the Champions League Cap@@ it@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph , with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
we were very close to this in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ ship Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ murder among young men will prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 was announced as the year of the man with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication chann@@ elled through social media , with a focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much more deeply .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared that money can really not buy happiness .
the beautiful thing with friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when soccer boots in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a staff of telep@@ hon@@ y care I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come on with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest alongside the new scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration
di Maria arrives to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria arrives at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they scored the points , there was no class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems to our opponents and look back even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I &apos;m sorry that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 monster on his own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was stab@@ bed to death by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was called the man to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ guess pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed to Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field str@@ ung a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos; posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave up , with some short@@ cuts and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ ed in the first half by no less than five attempts , after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot , which was driven by Wil@@ und in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth win of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could return to play , and only one outstanding intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacing actor Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi one goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying matches won &apos;t be enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola ham@@ pered change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously standing just before the engagement of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner @-@ winner , four times champion @-@ league champion , two times champion Champions , twice World Champion , a time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi reveals that he was already in Barcelona before the European Championships in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t say anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi would not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this now works for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi declares , why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns had run in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the grass , out@@ dated the reds from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown succ@@ um@@ bed to the need for alternative perspectives while insi@@ sting on a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen screen@@ play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with anno@@ yed un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Marti@@ an enth@@ r@@ alled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they handle the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a rage , struck by her white sne@@ ak@@ y .
the producer of Dear White People came to the film for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; in the end , her direction &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 cases since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement scored a nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record quiet matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned 1st Champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and user support Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant completing all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to reach the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac email ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not get any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge over it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m happy that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for eighth season , filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb in the second half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game card slot .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three R@@ uns possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in bull@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the sleeping line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said extre@@ mis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton concluded the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks scored a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the Wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who grab@@ bed a two @-@ Run away from the right @-@ handed la@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finale run at the second , Ver@@ hagen has made the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
after he added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn , Wall reached an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit became the pr@@ elu@@ de to the game of an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been stri@@ cken before the game from the list of injuries after he had missed more than a month for a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches da in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they got the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which created a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed with a single on the right , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers laid in second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit him very well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scor@@ ing no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J. A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the throw school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of vulner@@ abilities due to a shoulder break@@ age , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is kn@@ itted from the list of injuries to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the persons in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden hur@@ ried on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommodated there .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days alone , according to the government president responsible for the first recording , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military actions in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he presented the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective path@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one is sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement on which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Express .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany began with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new trial for a binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee surge in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first recording and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the Länder , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultation with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection also complain .
but those who don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye view can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view has been divided unanim@@ ously in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania was set up with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers of ev@@ asive floo@@ ding over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people crossing the fence .
in Turkey meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of other migrants on their way to the Greek border .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the moon easily stag@@ ger around the ring planet .
although this di@@ ver movement is small , yet too big for a consistently solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State University ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ mond which sp@@ ies water vap@@ or and ice @-@ particles and therefore feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 München several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1860 München &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation revealed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fores@@ ees four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ rau@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a unified professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the six@@ ties , however , initially presented a defensive fighter as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was also under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week .
the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h on his head .
contrary to his first fears , however , he remained without a serious sage .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - in particular su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel colour alone says nothing about how mature the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ona and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .
the U.S. parcel service U@@ PS delivers up to 9@@ 5000 aids for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
especially drivers are being looked for .
last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce to 9@@ 5,000 employees for the holiday season .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have taken precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries filed the parcel service for harsh criticism .
first blow @-@ up storm , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn wind , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and at night a Thursday blows the fo@@ eh@@ n partly with storm strength through the herd si@@ re .
after meeting on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front crosses us , which brings strong rainf@@ alls , gu@@ sts and a decline in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ news writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ west current .
on the alpine side of the Alps , the f@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night .
in the wake of Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n blows in the con@@ jun@@ ctions with bows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even Or@@ rab@@ bits from over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture begins to dust on the alpine slope .
here , rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps must be bil@@ led with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has already fallen in large rainf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow dryer enters the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures are going back significantly .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , however , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now acknowledged as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret over the centuries as a minority .
with the pla@@ za , it is symbo@@ lically visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a low @-@ yiel@@ ding sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him by historians in his later struggle against Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his theses , Luther had initiated the split of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his theses on the decline in the Oc@@ ci@@ dental Church .
hammer &quot; artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked for about three years on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
in doing so , he has immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective biblical places on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current context into today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who here formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to stop working so I might also be able to bear me with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to raise art again in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , to let them act , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; to have been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not pay attention to fully compreh@@ ending the Bible , but selected the most important , even mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arose a picture Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and linen paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
plans , place found , companies commissioned to model earth @-@ hed@@ geho@@ gs for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration ensured confusion , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want the train to tolerate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the First Common ä@@ tin Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to inform her in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitments for refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees up to 2019 and the Bundes@@ liga ends a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is responding to the acute situation in Germany and safegu@@ ards politics to help solve the problems facing it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle that nothing is going on me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal authorities also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will carry on the left tri@@ cot rather than the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Head of Sport Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football states , no , we need to use our bla@@ sting force , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent character of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the Euro qualification game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach defined the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their locations started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , the association provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already rec@@ alled the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Executive Board Chairman loses sight in accident
according to several reports , the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , was impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out on the road - that he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to rise up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen swe@@ ated an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a reserv@@ ist for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , just like a week later at the Great Prize of Japan .
proceedings Bv@@ B With@@ out R@@ eus Against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Gate
with Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load on its pros , Tu@@ va will not only change its parent pole position at the R@@ eus position .
thus he announced a change to the door @-@ keeper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master crafts@@ man Roman rei@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; though Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe league games in future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tu@@ chel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ceful statement of fellow players R@@ eus that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s Marco &apos;s not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot car : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany is to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the motor show IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Mobility Age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries which also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid conversion to digital radio .
to test new technology , a test track is currently being built on the 9 in Bavaria .
to ensure that the driver does not impose any additional liability risks , the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to set itself internationally for the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on high@@ ways to 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cars on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study evaluated the value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans still see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA For@@ sa Institute , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will enforce in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect that at all , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital state Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to surrender control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

after the present stand the Düsseldorf plans to open only in singles from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ master Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor appointment in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Chief European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who introduces the S@@ etz@@ liste in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; Timo also ste@@ als , and we have become Europe champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World R@@ emin@@ ist Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with it that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be easy , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung on 18 September , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exhibition sounded like death for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one arrives at the museum .
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly surprising work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , which has been used for much effort : to mechan@@ ize dolls , for example , a sty@@ list has been dedicated .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot made 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers &apos;s old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught himself to design fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
but later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery Jew@@ ellery in Stones - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , processed them to blanket and she@@ ers .
that alone is no longer functioning today , &quot; says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead , the fashion is again important .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze fashion has played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt name some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans against past styles is an increasing job potential .
anyone who does not use niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
Ravens@@ burger P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien , together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have broken away .
private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the bulk goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold via chains .
in addition , exports , according to Russia and the USA , are also weak@@ ening .
enough reasons therefore for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also seeks to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the embroi@@ der in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been running a seal of quality since this year that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Auß@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - specializing in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it creates a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that have to think economically , above all , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
some years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical top of the snow .
at the same time , the machine embroi@@ ders small glob@@ ules in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing forem@@ an Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from this : &quot; I could not do anything before with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the tip of the snow for her jewellery .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not about a new film adaptation , but a kind of continuation which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in the times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already firmly established : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider outward in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the reform of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leadership Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants reporting system .
according to the statement , a neg@@ ativity list is created , the sectors and companies identified that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a right @-@ state business environment and open the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the scope of an offer to open government controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury level in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to exploit the consumers with a significantly higher dose of nerve @-@ pesti@@ cide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised plans sharply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks and s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big predat@@ ors are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that about 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to shar@@ pen the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch referred to this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sin@@ king at Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ toxic heavy metal for the human being , which is strongly enriched over the food chain above all in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low quantities can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the maximum values applicable but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury gets into the environment mainly due to coal combustion .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet the Green Par@@ liam@@ entary Committ@@ ees of Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock in excess of six tons of mercury per year , two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
