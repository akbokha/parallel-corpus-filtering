should the core material , the securing measures are subject to this Convention , in case of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the Community thus agre@@ es with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated in accordance with this Convention in relation to this material .
II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives during the duration of the non @-@ application of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention .
B ) The organisation and community shall adopt a provision that the securing measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used for such activity .
as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied .
in any case , the securing measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is held up to date on the total amount and composition of this material in the State or the State concerned and on any passing on such material from this state or these states .
this explains their approval as quickly as possible ; it only covers issues such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include approval or sec@@ rec@@ y knowledge of military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow out of their respective obligations under the Convention .
if the community , the States or individuals , who are subject to their sovereignty , are subject to extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organisation , the organisation rei@@ mb@@ urse these costs , as long as it prepar@@ es itself in advance .
in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and sam@@ pl@@ ings required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and States make sure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organisation and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this agreement in the same manner as to the citizen of the States .
any claim that the community or state against the organization or the organisation against the Community or the Organization due to damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - must be asser@@ ted in accordance with international law .
if the Council re@@ affir@@ ms the objective information presented by the General Director , that the organisation has not been able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to this Convention , has been diver@@ ted for nuclear weapons or other core segments , so it can equi@@ p the reports provided in Article XII ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , also take measures provided there .
in such steps , the council , in which measure , was acquired by the applied securing measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every justi@@ fiable occasion to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , the community or a state consult@@ ations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to seek that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement will be examined by the Council .
the Council encourages the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions .
with the exception of disputes arising under Article 19 or any of the Council adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be made on the request of a party of arbit@@ ration , which consists of five arbit@@ rat@@ ors .
the community and the states design@@ ate two arbit@@ rat@@ ors , the organization also names two arbit@@ rat@@ ors , and the four arbit@@ rat@@ ors appointed by so named arbit@@ rat@@ ors elect a fifth , who leads the chair@@ manship .
if the Community and the States or the Organisation have not appointed two arbitr@@ ator three @-@ five days after the application for an arbitr@@ ator , the Community or Organisation may seek to ap@@ point the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure shall apply if binding three @-@ sig days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator of the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been chosen .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be charged , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rat@@ ors .
the decisions of the arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal shall be binding for the organisation , the community and the concerned states .
a ) The Convention shall be effective for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the respective state of the organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention .

the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures required during the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures as required .
the purpose of the securing measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention is the timely discovery of the sever@@ ity of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as the det@@ err@@ ence of such a reduction by the risk of premature discovery .
for the adequ@@ acy of the objective specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and monitoring as important supple@@ mentary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspec@@ tions by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period , is listed under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
during the execution of their investigations , the Organisation is making full use of the community securing system after article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their securing measures , the community will make use of the procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer to the supple@@ mentary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , her@@ edit@@ ary , offset , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock of removed core material and stock levels ;
B ) assessment of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing measuring uncertainty ;
C ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and recei@@ vers ;
e ) procedure for ass@@ essing accumulation of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which equi@@ ps the core material for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the balance sheet ;
g ) precau@@ tions that ensure accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) procedures for rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement of reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are not limited to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) will be introduced ur@@ anium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ent material , which is not yet reached under the letter c ) , which has not yet been entered into the States , thus divi@@ ding the community of the organization the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not implemented for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material , which is appropriate for the composition and purity of fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope application , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is established in the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The securing measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not authorised , the association and community consult each other on the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The securing measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the Community establish unanim@@ ously that this core material is virtually non @-@ ref@@ utable .
on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , when used in gram or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
( B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 if such core material is reg@@ ained , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the Organization &apos;s core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to the Convention , exemp@@ t from these securing measures , if the whole , due to this Article in the States , is no longer available as
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 % ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored along with core material , which is subject to the securing measures under the Convention , processed or stored , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .

the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or altered without alter@@ ing this agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mentary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement can enter into force ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report named in Article 62 , the Organization provides a consolidated sub@@ directory of the whole , the securing measures of this agreement underlying the underlying material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory of inventory based on the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation )
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ per@@ ed by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ rant problems .
C ) The aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States is bound by the Member States within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their utmost to achieve this goal .
d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central in@@ ventions to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has submitted a table from which it is evident in what way they are intended to apply the criteria set in this agreement -
the organisation dire@@ cts a special account under the name &quot; Special Action Account &quot; which the Member States contribute to the Special Action account ; this account is managed by the Organization as a ste@@ ward member and used ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions should be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ ins@@ ane gu@@ ilt of the Member State , which shall pay upon request in the currency of the respective State in order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the rear @-@ position of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first amoun@@ ting to at least 45 v . h . the supplement within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or any other between the E@@ EC and the Administrator at agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rema@@ inder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ very Member State may be able to make payments before the above mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker adop@@ ts about propor@@ tion@@ ate quot@@ ations on cash or the deb@@ tor to cover expenses for the lending loan and balance the transaction account appropri@@ ately .
in gran@@ ting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and predict@@ able economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further loan capacity for loan terms and conditions of loan , without discounts ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources .
each shareholder loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is independent of whether it belongs to the lending program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the purpose of the organization funded by the Organisation for the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of regular means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which is bound by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same amount of re@@ funds granted for the development loan granted by the Organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able at ten free years in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are directly linked to the organization that maintains it .
each loan has a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is specified , in particular .
the proceeds from each lending institution may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which the administrator defined at the time of loan granted , could be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of a loan agreement .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transactions are transferred to the Special Action account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State .
the administrator is informed until full allocation of all non @-@ performing loans to the E@@ EC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors through the directors in preparation .
during the time of the withdrawal of the F@@ TT loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the E@@ EC four times a year about the development of the special loan and the expenses made there@@ for .
the ste@@ ward transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the Organisation a detailed calculation of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will submit a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the Sonder@@ aktion@@ sm@@ onto .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and condu@@ cts suitable records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are made from the accounts recei@@ vable to the account depos@@ ited and depos@@ ited from the account , and the re@@ funds to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the full edition of the means of the special reaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by a special transaction report and on all other issues pert@@ aining to the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately .
if the total capital amount is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement is subject to author@@ isation by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the procedures concerned .
the General Secretariat dire@@ cts these notes together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month that follows the day of receipt of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two tran@@ scripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby any wording is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter change to change the Anne@@ x A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ OR@@ DN@@ UNG ER@@ LA@@ SS@@ EN :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ k
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and THE SW@@ IT@@ Z@@ ER@@ IC Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large trial facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a Joint Company after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Gemein@@ sames Enterprises J@@ ET &quot; ) .
Switzerland has been involved with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
because of the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion yet extensive work is carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summar@@ ize their relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which have attained a higher priority due to the energy crisis .
this agreement should enable every contracting party to avoid unnecessary over@@ lap by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs from the funds provided for mutual research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive power generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associ@@ ating their respective programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom program &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programm . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and the forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it is thus extended or modified by the organs named in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the parties accept a new program , this will be replaced by the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association designed in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom program ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
in the context of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association agreement en@@ vis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties excl@@ ude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is referred to as far as possible between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom program .
with the same objective Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland particip@@ ates with the time of the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated institutions , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Human Exchange . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland belongs to the Joint Business J@@ ET at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , whose statutes are accepted .
furthermore Eur@@ atom contributes to the fact that Switzerland can become the contractual partner of any contract , whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association en@@ vis@@ aged in Article 2 , 1 of the present agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
the association agreement fores@@ ees especially the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat .
