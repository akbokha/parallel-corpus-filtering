&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures required during the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures as required .
the purpose of the securing measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention is the timely discovery of the sever@@ ity of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as the det@@ err@@ ence of such a reduction by the risk of premature discovery .
for the adequ@@ acy of the objective specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and monitoring as important supple@@ mentary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspec@@ tions by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period , is listed under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
during the execution of their investigations , the Organisation is making full use of the community securing system after article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their securing measures , the community will make use of the procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer to the supple@@ mentary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , her@@ edit@@ ary , offset , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock of removed core material and stock levels ;
B ) assessment of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing measuring uncertainty ;
C ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and recei@@ vers ;
e ) procedure for ass@@ essing accumulation of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which equi@@ ps the core material for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the balance sheet ;
g ) precau@@ tions that ensure accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) procedures for rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement of reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are not limited to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) will be introduced ur@@ anium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ent material , which is not yet reached under the letter c ) , which has not yet been entered into the States , thus divi@@ ding the community of the organization the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not implemented for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material , which is appropriate for the composition and purity of fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope application , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is established in the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The securing measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not authorised , the association and community consult each other on the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The securing measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the Community establish unanim@@ ously that this core material is virtually non @-@ ref@@ utable .
on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , when used in gram or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
( B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 if such core material is reg@@ ained , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the Organization &apos;s core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to the Convention , exemp@@ t from these securing measures , if the whole , due to this Article in the States , is no longer available as
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 % ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored along with core material , which is subject to the securing measures under the Convention , processed or stored , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the Organisation of supple@@ mentary agreements , which is necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention , in the individual determine how the procedures set in the Convention are applicable .
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or altered without alter@@ ing this agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mentary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement can enter into force ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report named in Article 62 , the Organization provides a consolidated sub@@ directory of the whole , the securing measures of this agreement underlying the underlying material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory of inventory based on the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation )
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ per@@ ed by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ rant problems .
C ) The aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States is bound by the Member States within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their utmost to achieve this goal .
d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central in@@ ventions to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has submitted a table from which it is evident in what way they are intended to apply the criteria set in this agreement -
the organisation dire@@ cts a special account under the name &quot; Special Action Account &quot; which the Member States contribute to the Special Action account ; this account is managed by the Organization as a ste@@ ward member and used ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions should be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ ins@@ ane gu@@ ilt of the Member State , which shall pay upon request in the currency of the respective State in order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the rear @-@ position of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first amoun@@ ting to at least 45 v . h . the supplement within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or any other between the E@@ EC and the Administrator at agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rema@@ inder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ very Member State may be able to make payments before the above mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker adop@@ ts about propor@@ tion@@ ate quot@@ ations on cash or the deb@@ tor to cover expenses for the lending loan and balance the transaction account appropri@@ ately .
in gran@@ ting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and predict@@ able economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further loan capacity for loan terms and conditions of loan , without discounts ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources .
each shareholder loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is independent of whether it belongs to the lending program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the purpose of the organization funded by the Organisation for the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of regular means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which is bound by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same amount of re@@ funds granted for the development loan granted by the Organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able at ten free years in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are directly linked to the organization that maintains it .
each loan has a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is specified , in particular .
the proceeds from each lending institution may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which the administrator defined at the time of loan granted , could be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of a loan agreement .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transactions are transferred to the Special Action account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State .
the administrator is informed until full allocation of all non @-@ performing loans to the E@@ EC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors through the directors in preparation .
during the time of the withdrawal of the F@@ TT loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the E@@ EC four times a year about the development of the special loan and the expenses made there@@ for .
the ste@@ ward transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the Organisation a detailed calculation of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will submit a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the Sonder@@ aktion@@ sm@@ onto .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and condu@@ cts suitable records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are made from the accounts recei@@ vable to the account depos@@ ited and depos@@ ited from the account , and the re@@ funds to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the full edition of the means of the special reaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by a special transaction report and on all other issues pert@@ aining to the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately .
if the total capital amount is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement is subject to author@@ isation by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the procedures concerned .
the General Secretariat dire@@ cts these notes together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month that follows the day of receipt of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two tran@@ scripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby any wording is equally authentic .

in order to further simplify the procedure for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ff names in the event of unprecedented changes in the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it will also appear to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I encourage you to confirm the community &apos;s consent to these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you confirm the consent of your government to the above .
I honor to confirm you the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &quot; demands within the medium @-@ term financial state
the BI@@ Z could conclude stand@@ by agreement with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries , if the banks provide an appropriate application .
the agreement could be concluded until the total amount of the paid contribution to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , namely within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ ices ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for whose application the BIS would be ready .
with every stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extension leaves without the need for a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans , as well as with its monetary extension , the BIS would calculate a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first quot@@ ations will not be made before the end of a month after the end of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity .
the quot@@ ations would take place in the currencies available at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking account of the funds of the Bank , presum@@ ably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BIS addresses at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market value .
if the BI@@ Z has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds on the market itself , then the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum , which corresponds to the corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you gave me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ Z could close stand@@ by agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tors when the banks make a suitable application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you gave me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am pleased to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this writing .

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat
I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of ham and lamb are exist@@ ential after the world market and in particular after the community for the New Zealand economy , and that it must be ensured that the normal paragraph of New Zealand Lamb and Lamb is not affected in these markets , I honour the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
according to this agreement , New Zealand is guaranteed for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of Community in the level specified in the agreement .
new Zealand obt@@ ains the assurance that the normal paragraph of his amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the Regulation .
in order to ensure a fla@@ w@@ less functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the amount of the recorded amount did not exceed the set amount .
the pre@@ fixed amounts are carried out in the conventional tender forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community asser@@ ts that New Zealand should not be prevented from using this Agreement to use new technological developments or maintain its competitive position in the community market .
should a change in the supply form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two contractual parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the Committee referred to in Clau@@ se 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community uses the protection cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement .
in the event that imports from New Zealand cross the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the Community is obliged to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to imports of the products recorded by this agreement to a stool of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consult@@ ations with New Zealand changes the amounts set in cl@@ ause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State .
the import restrictions for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the rules of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account in Clau@@ se 5 of the ex@@ cre@@ tion mentioned in Clau@@ se 5 .
the total amount claimed in Clau@@ se 2 is determined with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 245 500 tons of batt@@ le@@ ground weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that ship@@ ments of frozen meat on frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Regulation .
in addition , the two parties undertake everything in order to promote the consumption of creative work in the community without any risk for market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agre@@ es that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , shall be in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the amounts mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
the community is oblig@@ ated to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products is made dependent on the origin in New Zealand from the submission of a export license issued by the authorities appointed by the New Zealand government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the question@@ able products .
it also stipul@@ ates that the competent New Zealand authority of the responsible body of the Community in regular intervals has been granted the quantities for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted on the basis of identification .

in the form of a letter change between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ö@@ st@@ lich of Uruguay on trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff of 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common customs tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen mam@@ mot@@ h , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff of 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common customs tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual quantity :
to ensure a fla@@ w@@ less functioning of the agreement , Uruguay oblig@@ es to ensure that the quantity in actual amount not exceeds the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the conventional quot@@ ations ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the supply form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the Committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community uses the protective cl@@ ause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the access to the community market regulated in this agreement will not be affected .
in the event that imports from Uruguay in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned .
the Community is obliged to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to the imports of products recorded by this agreement to a stool of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the quantity set in accordance with the scope of the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import restrictions for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the rules of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be invo@@ iced to the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz of exhaus@@ tion under number 5 .
the total volume named under number 2 is determined with the days of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 5 800 tons of batt@@ le@@ ground weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of conf@@ isc@@ ations of frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an production .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agre@@ es that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for export of amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , shall be in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms can be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by gran@@ ting the quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products specified under the number 1 .
the community oblig@@ es itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products is made dependent on the template of a export license which is assigned by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
it also stipul@@ ates that the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the responsible body of the Community in regular intervals has been granted the quantities for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted on the basis of identification .
this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the scope of that contract on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Uruguay on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing within a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they deemed necessary .
I would be grateful if you confirm the consent of your government with this letter .

C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
blood removal is performed as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sliding through a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was fu@@ elled before sterili@@ sation .
after completion of the blood pressure , the bottle is immediately sealed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution should not exceed 220 ml per litre of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per litre .
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously determined by the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; determination of the R@@ h factor is performed by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
if there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group identification in individual countries , these are applicable .
the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific tests have shown the absence of anti@@ gens C , D , Du und E .

a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the greatest part of plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cells can be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial ir@@ rig@@ ation solution , which was added after removal of plasma .
the volume of red blood cells should amount to between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of the ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is indicated on the label .
all processes required for production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the removal must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and only by pressure .

in order to reduce the risk of transfer@@ ring I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation h@@ epatitis , there are mix@@ tures that contain no more than 12 donations , or apply other methods that are known to reduce this risk in a comparable way .
one of the liquid quantity required in the production of the plasma is to add the corresponding amount of water ; the substance must be fully resolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
a given quantity plasma is dissolved in the amount of water equivalent to the amount of liquid made from which it is produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests :
II ) puts 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , so co@@ ag@@ ulation occurs ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 C .

solutions from human alb@@ um@@ in and fac@@ tions from human plasma proteins are stored in ster@@ ile , sealed containers under exclusion of micro@@ organisms . they are to be protected from light and at a temperature of 4 to 6 C .
the label on the container contains all data recorded on the corresponding socket ( Anne@@ x 4 ) .
the normal human immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin is a compound made of plasma proteins , which is made out of human , the antibody of normal adult blood .
the method used must ensure that the final product has the further described conditions and does not transmit I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation h@@ epatitis .
in addition , the manufacturing method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the output product are concentrated in sufficient quantities in the final product .
the method is satis@@ factory for each end product in this respect if antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in are ti@@ tri@@ fied in the initial and final product .
during production , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacterial substance must be added ; to ensure the bacterial ster@@ ility and stability of the final product , a suitable preser@@ v@@ ative and a suitable stabili@@ sation agent can be added .
the final product is delivered as a solution whose immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ in@@ concentration must be between 100 and 170 g per litre .

a re@@ agent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples that contain an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by ever renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated by the volume of the blood cells in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or any other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present standards .
according to definition , an international standard prepar@@ atory contains a certain number of Internation@@ aler units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group identification of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating sti@@ cker which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding .
the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group identification , available for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sc@@ iss@@ ors contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International &apos;s anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should remain valid at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to label rests at most one year after the last satis@@ factory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the governmental super@@ visory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container where they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 BC of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de in a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg in 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent government authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solv@@ ents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance remains the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein Nit@@ rogen per ml flu@@ x or recur@@ rent ser@@ ums .
re@@ agents , whether in a fluid form or after re @-@ release , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group@@ ings should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally as possible , at least as long as an international agreement reached about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group identification are to be distributed in such a way and in such amounts that the re@@ agent being located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has to perform written records on all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents .
appropriate samples of all the re@@ agents shown are so long to be kept from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the efficacy and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container , a black printed label is available in English and French , containing the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required to re @-@ release ,
furthermore , this label or label on the cardboard box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following specifications : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
