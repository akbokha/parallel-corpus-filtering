<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation)</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general ressourcentrant problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The aim of the EEC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States is bound by the Member States within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do their utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central inventions to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has submitted a table from which it is evident in what way they are intended to apply the criteria set in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organisation directs a special account under the name "Special Action Account" which the Member States contribute to the Special Action account; this account is managed by the Organization as a steward member and used (in this capacity the organization is referred to as "caretaker), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions should be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-insane guilt of the Member State, which shall pay upon request in the currency of the respective State in order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the rear-position of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Every Member State may be able to make payments before the above mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker adopts about proportionate quotations on cash or the debtor to cover expenses for the lending loan and balance the transaction account appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="741">In granting these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and predictable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further loan capacity for loan terms and conditions of loan, without discounts; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each shareholder loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development program or project (including a sectoral project), which is independent of whether it belongs to the lending program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the purpose of the organization funded by the Organisation for the preamble to this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this watch are directly linked to the organization that maintains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each loan has a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is specified, in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each lending institution may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, which are members of the organization and which the administrator defined at the time of loan granted, could be a beneficiary of a loan agreement.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transactions are transferred to the Special Action account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator is informed until full allocation of all non-performing loans to the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors through the directors in preparation.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the withdrawal of the FTT loans, the caretaker will inform the EEC four times a year about the development of the special loan and the expenses made therefor.</seg>
<seg id="755">The steward transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the Organisation a detailed calculation of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditor of the organization to this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC will submit a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the Sonderaktionsmonto.</seg>
<seg id="757">The caretaker creates and conducts suitable records and invoices, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, which are made from the accounts receivable to the account deposited and deposited from the account, and the refunds to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker to the full edition of the means of the special reaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by a special transaction report and on all other issues pertaining to the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the Organisation may agree, the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately.</seg>
