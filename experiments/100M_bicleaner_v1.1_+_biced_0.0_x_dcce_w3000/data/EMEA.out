this document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the conducted studies in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please refer to the package sample ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. ver@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental illness in which patients have man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods of an@@ or@@ mal high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and to prevent man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lo@@ wing tablets .
in patients taking other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably primarily acts as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for recep@@ tors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recep@@ tors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing mental or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy In@@ j@@ ection Solution was compared in 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder caused by increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment was examined .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution for intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
while applying to treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of some epis@@ odes in previously treated patients as plac@@ ebo for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ amid@@ ale disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , tre@@ mor ( di@@ zzy ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder , and in preventing a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic epis@@ odes and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes were respon@@ ding to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , out@@ weigh the risks .
furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission approved Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . approval for A@@ bili@@ fy in@@ roads across the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic epis@@ odes and discussed their man@@ ic epis@@ odes on the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors warran@@ t this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ctor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the inci@@ dence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to mental disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no higher risk of suicide with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturb@@ ance ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including a cell @-@ treated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
when patients treat symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sent@@ in@@ esia with A@@ bili@@ fy , consider reducing the dose or canc@@ elling the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ium , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system caution is advisable if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ acting drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically non @-@ relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased AU@@ C by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reduction should be carried out .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ aboli@@ sm can result in the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ aboli@@ sm .
considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should prevail over the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ oren , have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reduction should be carried out .
after setting up the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , A@@ bili@@ fy dosage should be lifted to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( Dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the insufficient data base for human security and , due to the concerns raised in animal reproduction , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative impact on them .
the following adverse events occ@@ ured more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below depends on the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with os@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine @-@ controlled laboratory parameters emerged , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the adverse events reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence also in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and con@@ vul@@ sions , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes Mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death succession .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is of benefit in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has high plasma cutting .
it is thought that the effectiveness of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I interfer@@ es on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
in the dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , by the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the share of respon@@ der patients who considered a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an ob@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dosage of 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without mental features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol presented a week 3 efficacy against plac@@ ebo , which was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
additionally , in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without mental features , which partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension of over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was thinking about the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in preventing a revers@@ al in the mania .
based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ de of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the middle elimination of eli@@ minate is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in exten@@ sive met@@ ab@@ s@@ ants via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and there were no sex@@ ually dependent effects in a phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients .
a population @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different radi@@ ant liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh grade A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the potential potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant adren@@ al tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81@@ p@@ ples of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human gen@@ us at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole are no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dosage , which led to ex@@ positions of the mid @-@ Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C during the recommended clinical maximum dose .

as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and to minimize vari@@ ability , injection is recommended in the del@@ to@@ id muscle or deep into glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under circum@@ scription of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status considering the medicine used for maintenance or Ak@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment is indicated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for intake .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection in patients with Agi@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al dys@@ functions caused by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme distress or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescri@@ bing or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturb@@ ance ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including a cell @-@ treated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .

clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS include high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ium , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally seen in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ic due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of sed@@ ation was greater compared with that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study , in healthy volunteers ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as a dispos@@ able intr@@ amus@@ cular one and which simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cular .
105 The H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically non @-@ relevant .

in another study of 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine @-@ controlled laboratory parameters emerged , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the adverse events reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence also in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and con@@ vul@@ sions , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in symptoms regarding the Agi@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances in comparison with plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the average improvement observed on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Com@@ ponent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe at@@ tili@@ zation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) compared to plac@@ ebo showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the share of respon@@ der patients who considered a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an ob@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was thinking about the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in preventing a revers@@ al in the mania .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection . the system@@ ic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers lay the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated gift during a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which lay 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity according to intra@@ ven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns arose after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) about the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the potential potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant adren@@ al tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the average dose @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average dose @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dosage , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ fold the mean @-@ state AU@@ C during the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , about three quarters earlier an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration and as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer have no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time and wor@@ sen@@ ing of disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer were in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ roph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients whose first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , drugs do not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission approved the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not shown and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ roph@@ ils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
for sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached at Grade 1 or 2 , and the dosage must be reduced in all subsequent cycles .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were performed with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to not sufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could significantly other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no renewed abra@@ x@@ ane cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ roph@@ ils count increased to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ anes .
whereas a cor@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity related to abra@@ x@@ ane has not been detected , cardi@@ ac occur@@ ren@@ ces are not unusual in the indicated patient group , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if the patient is treated with abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ tion method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to testi@@ fy during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised before treatment for sperm conservation , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ versible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect traffic and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events occurring in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly re@@ versible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane gift as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ ine hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orous in the blood , reduced pot@@ assium in the blood heart disease :

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the mig@@ rating of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing its de@@ hydr@@ ation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cellular functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in vit@@ ro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ an recep@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ binding protein particles SPAR@@ C ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two unanim@@ ous un@@ verb@@ al studies and of 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medication to the contrac@@ eption of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ as@@ ation and 19 % because of metast@@ as@@ ation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy for the ending on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
active ingredient exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased in a multi @-@ phase way .
the mean volume of distribution was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high volume of distribution points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ or@@ ascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ vent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dosage ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .

this means that bot@@ t@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood loss is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ bot@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be done by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have obtained an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults respectively between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients are to be controlled prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , ana@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus dimin@@ ish the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been produced that enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , compared to the reference doctor .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were either converted to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of secre@@ tion under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy alone .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused ana@@ emia , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of patients who were ren@@ amed to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as for those who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who still received an E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing , mig@@ raine head@@ ache and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
bot@@ t@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical personnel in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug .
August 2007 , the European Commission approved Medi@@ ce medicinal products P@@ ütter GmbH &amp; Co KG for placing se@@ amed into the European Union .
treatment of ana@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing ana@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger operative interventions , which require a large blood volume set ( 4 or more units of blood for men ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ bot@@ amed can be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml used , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease condition is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in one patient over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for controlling ana@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week using intra@@ ven@@ ous application if necessary with an increase in dose of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease condition is required by the doctor .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ id number of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ id number &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ id rate by ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl , the dose should be maintained three times a week by 300 I.@@ E. / kg .
on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ v@@ ae is required , Ab@@ bot@@ amed should receive a weight of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each succ@@ essive days , on the day of the surgery , as well as 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients who are suffering from a ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in a ery@@ th@@ rob@@ last@@ min@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ last@@ open@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ oris , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ bs ) .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , vo@@ ic@@ ular or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurring cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ last@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the appearance of a medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of a non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ ums , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ emia ( i.e. the prec@@ ari@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / mic@@ rol@@ iter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone condu@@ it to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the maximum limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
in clinical trials an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit due to epo@@ et@@ ines , when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is elevated above the concentration needed to control the an@@ emia symptoms and the avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under section 4.2 , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
according to the present findings by the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated .
for the evaluation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy efficiency , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa administration and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who may need to be trans@@ med ) for the evaluation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy efficiency .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustments with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing system involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , the cause of ana@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly prior to the on@@ set of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that for treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic ana@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red
when epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ do@@ sis should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit .
in vit@@ ro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF with regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ ors can come to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications .
the gene@@ tically @-@ extracted epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ulated and is identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate portion identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of native patients .
it could be shown using cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ cop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were examined in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with a re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ emia due to several more common mal@@ ign@@ om@@ es consistent an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um mirrors which are achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um mirrors remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first dose or 24 hours after the last gift .

in the first study , almost 8@@ 0,000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that decreases bone substance ) in the blood once more norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % vis @-@ à @-@ vis the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ause had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion centre and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ loss ( the death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information material for doctors that prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to apply the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transportation of A@@ cl@@ asta across the European Union .

the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment plant • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and with breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When medical or nursing aid is accessed
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after using A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with ren@@ al dys@@ functions ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) Dos@@ age adjustments are not necessary , as bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination are similar to older patients .
children and adol@@ escents from A@@ cl@@ asta are not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years of age as data are missing for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of the treatment ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , occasionally sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene should be induced prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ onate treatment with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental procedures , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw region .
clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after using A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
inci@@ dence of severe side effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ause ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ ZON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.@@ 1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which are associated with a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as absolute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ atine in 10 days of the dose was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ause compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium @-@ values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were treated at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion site such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw region became kno@@ w@@ ingly , particularly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ loss in the jaw area in a patient diagnosed with A@@ cl@@ asta and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing flu@@ idi@@ zed body tincture .
effects on morph@@ ometric ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta sen@@ sed significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared with plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar lin@@ ol@@ ei@@ c acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 increase in bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the thig@@ h h@@ als by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In the case of 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic cavity were taken .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ular bone volume in comparison with plac@@ ebo , and the retention of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peripher@@ al intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ause reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON @-@ RF@@ T study , the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment increased compared to plac@@ ebo treatment by BM@@ D at the total hip and thig@@ h h@@ als at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ ums@@ y treatment led to an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in the total hip and by 4.3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als over a period of 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON RF@@ T study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the inci@@ dence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ause @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of A@@ cl@@ asta was compared to the once @-@ weekly administration of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate related to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ asta has been studied in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically proven , especially light to moderate weight mor@@ bus pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirrors of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2.@@ 6@@ ples of age @-@ specific upper normal value when taken into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in an observ@@ ational phase .
from the 143 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared with 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at will be maintained at a mean duration of the observ@@ ational period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minute inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ ed independent .
after that the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the highest value .
rapid bi@@ phase dis@@ appearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination of the elimination of ½ γ 146 hours .
the early phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body clear@@ ance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zinc acid concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a decreased clearance of met@@ abolic substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because it is not yet metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ versible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron Acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 studied patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and regular ren@@ al dysfunction down to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
because for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al compatibility of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was given in rats by dos@@ ed doses of 0.@@ 6@@ mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the seven @-@ times human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in ec@@ uli@@ zed ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the planned human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point were performed .
the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , an inf@@ est@@ ation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to reduced ser@@ um calcium .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the preparation and conditions before the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ onate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus pa@@ get of the bone .
decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made of andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass observed in men .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure takes place too quickly , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material we@@ aker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ asta works by restor@@ ing the bone structure again , ensuring a normal bone formation and therefore gives the bone strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
use A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist or care staff if you use / apply other medicines and / or have used it recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs from which it is known that they damage the kid@@ neys .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and drink , make sure that you take sufficient liquid in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip .
the usual dose is 5 mg , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
since A@@ cl@@ asta looks for a long time , you may need another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta Falls you are considering ending the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after inf@@ usions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain , and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
at present , it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ ause is causing this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta .

if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to carry the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .

A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or several I
in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive means of setting up smoking compared to plac@@ ebo .
on the other hand , studies on the attitude of smoking showed no consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) were noted , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tissue .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can provo@@ ke su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( drug against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a drug used for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obes@@ ity or over@@ weight
medicine used in patients who require it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing treatment packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z
supple@@ mentary to diet and exercise for the treatment of obes@@ ity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or over@@ weight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which are beyond one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the conducted studies in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ etic medication ) is not indicated .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which can not be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ onic acid or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients who Ac@@ tos additionally took insulin , reduced H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who received plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturb@@ ances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ge@@ tic ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in a mon@@ otherapy ( at the sole use ) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
October 2000 , the European Commission approved Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or int@@ oler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ er@@ ascular disease has been performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with elevated liver enz@@ ym@@ ers ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror increases to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers are checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction like e.g. un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , over@@ bau@@ ch@@ ment , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be conducted by the clinical assessment to the extent of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be due to fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution in the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a slight reduction of mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred .
similar changes were observed in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oma ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , the pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one can be used as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as a two @-@ way combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ depend@@ ant hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , about a occurrence or a deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but dist@@ res@@ sing physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disturb@@ ances of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ological examination should be taken into consideration .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated Fra@@ ktur inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is to be canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ indu@@ ctor ) resulted in lower AU@@ C by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia developed during pregnancy and increased insulin resistance to the mother animal can be reduced and reduced the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not in@@ valuable from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the re@@ fr@@ active index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents above three times the upper limit of the standard range also frequently occur as below plac@@ ebo , but less rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the inci@@ dence of severe con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ p .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure .
a summar@@ izing analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies spann@@ ing a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active Study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose load in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is ref@@ uted ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite the three @-@ month optimisation period with insulin , were random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.45 % , compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent in clinical trials compared to the bas@@ eline values was observed in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slight but clin@@ ically non @-@ significant L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced in comparison to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the gen@@ ders tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ cor@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in approximately the triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ indu@@ ctor ) or lo@@ wers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after or@@ ally application of radio@@ active marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in waste ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance resem@@ ble themselves .
in tox@@ ic@@ ology studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys consistent after repeated administration of plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and re@@ versible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia developed in gest@@ ation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal can be reduced and reduced the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) of the ureth@@ ral epithel@@ ium were induced .
in an animal model of the aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ ces led to increased inci@@ dence of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors .
the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ ktur inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , there was a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent in clinical trials compared to the bas@@ eline values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the gen@@ ders tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ cor@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study l@@ acked the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ct , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation up@@ stream of the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular risks associated with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and of more than 7,@@ 400 patients who received compar@@ ative medication showed an increased inci@@ dence of bone frac@@ tures in women .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicated that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin analog .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package sample ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane over@@ l@@ apped the risks of diabetes in relation to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the allocation of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level is significantly improved by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients , where hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurring after switching from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin .
before travelling , which pass over several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the allocation of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id to the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the fast acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If the change to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id is required for the patient a dose adjustment , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which pass over several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .

the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adol@@ escents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adol@@ escents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gyp@@ sum ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ alli@@ zations that can lead to joint and bone condu@@ ction ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased at once daily 120 mg .
during the first six months of treatment , rheum@@ atism can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients will continue to use A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic for the first six months of treatment for the prevention of g@@ out attacks .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ural dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood lay in the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first trial 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients received 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients taking 120 mg once daily , with the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia due to diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently available and / or oste@@ o@@ arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid reservoir still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be considered .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
for children and adol@@ escents there are no experiences with children and adol@@ escents , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts as there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease is not recommended for patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ ns@@ ous medicines , a acute g@@ out attack can occur during the course of treatment , because the reduction of the ser@@ um acid levels initially can mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before beginning of the treatment of Feb@@ u@@ ary and subsequent clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ ange did not perform in@@ effectiveness studies on Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in the case of subjects , the simultaneous dosage of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in Feb@@ rau@@ x exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient applied at the same time .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C by D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a potential weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ . ost@@ at to the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , delayed the absorption of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a reduction in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include any side effects from February ux@@ est@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , using machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall treatment group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 vs. 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences could be found and no caus@@ al link could be detected with Feb@@ oy@@ ost@@ at .
the risk factors determined by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events occurring in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ oy@@ ost@@ at and which were reported as a total of more than once in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to one year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all February treatment arms and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ oy@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hyp@@ a@@ esth@@ esia , con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ age , der@@ mal in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in pot@@ assium concentration in the blood , decrease in T@@ SH concentration in the blood , decrease in the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
the mechanism of ur@@ ic acid in humans is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism and arises as part of the reaction cas@@ cade hyp@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
Feb@@ rau@@ ost@@ at is a pot@@ ent , not pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vit@@ ro @-@ inhibit@@ or located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in each study where the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ um car@@ cin@@ ine value at the beginning of the study of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study demonstrated the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um car@@ cin@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ized for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of the ser@@ um resin equivalent to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the physician in week 2 and permanently maintained throughout the treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 times a day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer &lt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al dys@@ functional restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage revers@@ al of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , despite their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl 200 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in ser@@ um acid levels increased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a g@@ out delay in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment for a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the g@@ out node size , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from February ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally .
for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.6 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentration was observed , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 litres after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma cutting of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 99.@@ 2 % ( primary bonds to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent with the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ oy@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the urine found itself as un@@ modified Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
apart from the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ modified Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ oy@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of Feb@@ oy@@ ost@@ at took about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restrictions After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , in approximately 11 @-@ times the exposure to humans .
these findings are regarded as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and re@@ productive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were approximately 4 @-@ times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity occurred , which accompanied by lowering the increase in the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions which are about the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which , about 13 times the human@@ ist exposition , have no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose required for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , p@@ ains of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of diges@@ tive appar@@ at@@ uses such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ c@@ era ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ c@@ era ) , tum@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous ab@@ domin@@ als ( blo@@ ated belly ) as well as sau@@ res .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other components AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE may not be applied .
it may not be used for diseases of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for the transfer of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE to the European Union .
capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following references are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not che@@ w the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , such as op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ ign@@ ant frac@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be pointed out to remedy the symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain when swal@@ lo@@ wing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of he@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or use it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions can be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no increased risk was detected , there were rare ( after market introduction ) gast@@ ric and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ loss of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regime mainly contains intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ onate .
there are no data available which indicate whether or not to use bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who need a max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial surgery that reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should take the tablet in the next morning with the om@@ ission of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should be treated adequ@@ ately prior to the beginning of the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate res@@ or@@ ption if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor of lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported about it in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
nevertheless , descent of the ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ um up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occur in both treatment groups with similar inci@@ dence .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate The therapeutic equ@@ ability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was detected in a one @-@ year multi @-@ centre study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures inci@@ dence of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 459 ) .
in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day amounted to 8.@@ 8 % in the spine compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the con@@ sol@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 3,@@ 2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.3 % ) was achieved in the percentage of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the incl@@ ines of the BM@@ D of ver@@ teb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continue to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continues to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased to about 0.46 % and 0,@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before standardized breakfasts .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant variation in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats show that al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is temporarily distributed in ham@@ mer@@ ed tissues after intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active ingredient was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the waste .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic clearing not exceeding 200 ml / min .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by rats with the kid@@ neys or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is influenced by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of radio@@ active marked vitamin D3 to healthy volunteers , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the share of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , however , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in the animal tests is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a somewhat increased accumulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in bones can be expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) .

adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered adult patients who have transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent transplan@@ ting the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study on 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation were presented , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which transplan@@ tation was rejected after a year of treatment ( for example , investigating how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or re @-@ absorption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and doctors need to be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the simultaneously perceived medication may need to be adjusted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations
after switching from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be checked before switching and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure , measured as tal@@ low levels , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate re @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow or@@ ale intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ graf 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the preparation of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendation - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments can be later required , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendation - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
dose recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t recep@@ tor of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ graf capsules at once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a transition from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin for pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recep@@ tors , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f at lun@@ gen@@ - , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as@@ - and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , in an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0,2 mg / kg / day , in case of p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ ed patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0,3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may be necessary for patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Because kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cancer levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is recommended ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of blood in whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the aid of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirror controls .
it is recommended frequent inspec@@ tions of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustments , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t patients , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in consequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be re@@ frac@@ tory against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
for pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recei@@ vers and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data are available for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a degra@@ dation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered because the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ graf , which therefore can also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid transfer and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision disturb@@ ances , should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ated , lac@@ t@@ ose contain , there are special caution in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels at the same dose of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A met@@ abolic change and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly due to the elevated oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly @-@ dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs can be metaboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism affects .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive action must be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially decrease the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in the uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ activity of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the by @-@ effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zed .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level are likely to be convey@@ ed by the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ lic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ ent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction due to the T cell , thus preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus suppres@@ ses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor .

overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ graf in these published studies revealed observations in the major studies in which Pro@@ graf was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis over a recently conducted , multic@@ enter study with oral Pro@@ graf , more than 110 patients were reported , who received tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 38.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients killed by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 57.@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the patient transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ splan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study the inci@@ dence of the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi@@ centric trial with oral Pro@@ graf was performed to 205 patients who were simultaneously receiving a pan@@ cre@@ ase and kidney transplan@@ tation , which were random@@ ised to receive a random@@ ized procedure with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for achieving the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
bo@@ wel graf@@ ting The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ graf as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant according to intestinal transplan@@ tations showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ founded fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism due to treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via the bile .
the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ graf for stable patients ( once daily ) at Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
it is recommended frequent inspec@@ tions of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .

adv@@ ent is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ent is applied to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables them to form the human scent factor VIII .
adv@@ ent is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ent in prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic periods was &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ent ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ent may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG for the placing of Adv@@ ent in the whole European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the VIII deficiency , after the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma concentrations ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
repeat once every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , reach different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value periods .
3 pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be dos@@ ed between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by a proper dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not exceed 10 ml / min .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma through modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ posi@@ tional days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ n@@ esia known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A for women there are no experiences concerning the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the AD@@ R@@ s , which were occurring in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who showed a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not predict@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ rors in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th post@@ operative day .
in clinical trials involving A@@ DV@@ OC to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed difficult to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 ex@@ posi@@ tional days ( ≥ 150 days ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed difficult to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was established .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins has been analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a prolonged peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the inci@@ dence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash @-@ r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ OC were performed at pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in below stand@@ ingly table 3 .

based on the data available since the first approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits @-@ risk weighing system as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , has decided to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited officially announced that the company res@@ umes its application for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breasts , the brain , bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) is affected .
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ant@@ ine is an &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and thus no infections can be solved in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP tested the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the documents submitted initially , the CH@@ MP on Day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ant@@ ine in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ent can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ os@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever , caused by allergy to p@@ ollen , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al sw@@ elling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adol@@ escents aged 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice daily a tablet which is to be taken with or without food altogether with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) , are ab@@ brevi@@ ated .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be ref@@ uted for con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main activity dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed using a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when looking at all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ os@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ ina@@ ze showed a relief of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug used to treat allergi@@ es ) is not to be applied .
aer@@ os@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a tight angle glau@@ coma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( stroke caused by stroke ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the allocation of Aer@@ ina@@ ze to the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or che@@ wing ) .
due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time .
after decline in the sw@@ elling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ ina@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors respectively within 2 weeks following the completion of such therapy .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , er@@ go@@ amin , di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , which can be per@@ ally or nas@@ al as a sw@@ elling r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ ol ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data do not suff@@ ice to pronoun@@ ce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of an aer@@ os@@ ine were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pronoun@@ ce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment has to be removed in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or p@@ alp@@ itations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of the head@@ ache ) .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hy@@ dati@@ d throat or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ os@@ ze is to be performed at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions on Indi@@ cators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ome were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with plac@@ ebo and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not inhi@@ bited , and in vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ os@@ ine during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , have no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the inci@@ dence of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct@@ ant properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ os@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a C@@ NS depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a C@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ al trials .

a C@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ dry , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flu@@ x , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was detected at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can evo@@ ke more sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a C@@ NS arous@@ al .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 414 patients receiving Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the overall cor@@ es ( except nas@@ al sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the dimin@@ ishing effect , determined by the nas@@ al sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
efficacy of car@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of an individual dose @-@ study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ kin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ os@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow balance was reached from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose therapy , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were poor@@ ly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) from P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure according to an aer@@ os@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not recognize any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in re@@ productive @-@ risk studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in Module 1 8.1 of the application for author@@ isation , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance that can un@@ fold its effect .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets rel@@ ieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and dro@@ wning or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnos@@ ing the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of Aer@@ ina@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • heart ch@@ asing , heart p@@ alp@@ itations • Heart ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache or rein@@ forcing existing head@@ aches .
if you take antibiotics with other medicines please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
transport and loading machinery For application in recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ ob@@ li@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or de@@ composed the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ ina@@ ze when you should know instantly your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger quantity of aer@@ os@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the dose of a dose , if you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects not specified in this use @-@ information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth @-@ dr@@ en@@ ching , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thir@@ st , fatigue , head@@ ache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ettle r@@ ash and sw@@ elling ) or skin r@@ ashes .
about cases of p@@ alp@@ itations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , stomach complaint , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , num@@ b@@ ness , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of eye @-@ catching liver data has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml @-@ solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup respectively .
for children from six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving some 4@@ 800 adults and adol@@ escents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies on patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ r@@ olas , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ e and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harm@@ less .
in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom ( symptom number ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company to transport A@@ eri@@ us in the whole European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ kin in adol@@ escents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous illness and may be res@@ um@@ ed after the symptoms of the symptoms .
in the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient may be recommended during the allergy @-@ time a continuing treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while using A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the imp@@ ending effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escents from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , which was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with the mac@@ ab@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multiple dose study administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ essen in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine administered at a dose of 45 mg a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear @-@ flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be classified as alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal ac@@ r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was studied for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hi@@ stam@@ ine replacement is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also leading to an improvement in symptoms even in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of sp@@ ind@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ ching around more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ance significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patient demo@@ ographi@@ es were comparable to the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients had reached a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out .
in @-@ vi@@ vo , not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ icity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ kin can not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us may be taken regardless of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience higher concentration levels ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which metaboli@@ zes limited is identical to that in children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not use her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not ampli@@ fy the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall inci@@ dence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adol@@ escents in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adol@@ escents , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ do@@ sis of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the progression of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ kin can be extr@@ ap@@ oli@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adol@@ escents in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ essen in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ escents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ essen in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval did not appear .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adol@@ escents conducted clinical studies on no imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not cause a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced imp@@ air@@ ment and an increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear @-@ flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decrease the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of sp@@ ind@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in che@@ wing g@@ um ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which can be restricted .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ escents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine were comparable to the recommended doses with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .

immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate can be removed without dam@@ aging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interim data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ essen in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was revealed .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was detected at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day .
in a 17 single dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear @-@ flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal ac@@ r@@ hin@@ itis .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ kin in adol@@ escents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without dam@@ aging it .
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting Tablets proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for the det@@ ecting Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically in a clinical study with multiple doses , which was used in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ essen in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poor@@ ly met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was , however , not different from that of the general population .
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for intake were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not tested on pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in conjunction with the dose detection studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the overall inci@@ dence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2,3 % ) were reported in inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months .
in an additional study , no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 have been observed in an additional study of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution .
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ kin ( see under section 5.2 ) in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can alternatively also be observed in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and
as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal ac@@ r@@ hin@@ itis .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced that the company with@@ draws its application for approval for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vacc@@ ine as &quot; physically alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this means that the immune system will later be able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane h@@ ull of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognis@@ es as a foreign body ) was dis@@ connected , st@@ oned and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the extent of the clinical data basis for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vacc@@ ine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are participating in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for use , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
a@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood that the virus is addressed to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight .
as@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV levels in the blood when combined with other anti@@ viral drugs and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral agents , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics .
this with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who used to prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml under plac@@ ebo after 48 weeks , but a@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral load , but only very few of the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug used with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
a@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are just like a@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune reaction syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
a@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of a@@ gener@@ ics in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants have not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase was originally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit for Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited for the allocation of a@@ gener@@ a in the whole European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually , a@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of a@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for a@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ gener@@ ics combined with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
a@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of a@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice a day , based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data .
the simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver function disturb@@ ance it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ cation 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements that contain Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase prevents the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , a@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with previously restricted liver function including a chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ a and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids being metaboli@@ sed via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ation effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and suppres@@ sions of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of a@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active substance concentrations .
in patients taking these medicines at the same time , a@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is simultaneously given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col@@ ein hal@@ ts of the a@@ gen@@ ase solution to intake , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
a@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the inci@@ dence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy drugs were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
at hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ic thro@@ sis occur .
at the time of introducing an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ loss were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ cation 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ sed via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in AU@@ C by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the low plasma level by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often undes@@ irable effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirrors by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the ammon@@ ium levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the cur@@ rant .
dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
508 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment schem@@ atics .
52 % hum@@ bled when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance since the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
no phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic study was performed in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the recei@@ pts from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and a@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would er@@ low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in may be lo@@ wered the concentration of the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is advisable since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
if this medicine is used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult .
the simultaneous dosage of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin around 193 % and thus to a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data exists .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , but the plasma level of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if applied together with a@@ gener@@ a , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these drugs when used in combination with a@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase since it can lead to res@@ or@@ ption dis@@ rup@@ tions .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ sions known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a decrease of the plasma level of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine ,
simultaneous intake with a@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , vision disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dosage of a@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ation effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases of the plasma level are expected in con@@ current administration of a@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased in the con@@ current dose of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , a@@ gener@@ a must not be used together with oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while taking care of as@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors point to a possible increase of the Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma bar around the 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the slight negli@@ gence of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation is currently being given as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose is adjusted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in con@@ current administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predict@@ able , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passed in humans into the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ung to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight in the descendants during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of the descendants , including fertility and re@@ productive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occ@@ ured early and rarely led to treatment abor@@ tion .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of a@@ gen@@ ase or another medicine used to treat HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics did not receive 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and fa@@ it sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ covered persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ack ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , combined with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular @-@ optic nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occ@@ ured during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ loss cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of introducing an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received a@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often occ@@ ured .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures are necessary .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the proc@@ essi@@ on@@ ation of viral Gag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins prec@@ urs@@ ors with the consequence of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ranges from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ r@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r imaging schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ oren - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be studied in gen@@ otyp@@ ically .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics of previously untreated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 54@@ L , A@@ 71@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ r@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occur :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ former resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / C , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M combined with an elevated phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for ass@@ essing the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ r@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ former resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r to treatment start and another against Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ former resistant isol@@ ates ; the retention of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resist@@ or mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side catalog ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly sacrific@@ ed with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ and@@ older ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to a@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ sub@@ ordination of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ lower threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of untreated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , gen@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.@@ 5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients involved in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data , treatment optimisation should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ p@@ oo@@ ster@@ ised &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration the mean duration ( T@@ max ) amounts to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of invol@@ unt@@ ary am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .

the gift of a@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase solution and a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regim@@ ents lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical applications , there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .

this liver tox@@ icity may be monitored and proven in clinical life through the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases .
until now , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of a@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure under therapeutic dose in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of a@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for a@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with weak or light liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disturb@@ ance it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .

a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance since the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would er@@ low .

when a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream once he / she notice it and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and applied in the cleaned skin area infected with co@@ wards until the cream is completely covered .
there should be a reduction in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a reduction in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rep@@ ul@@ sion or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host response .
in other studies in which no daily pre @-@ h@@ ass@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with a female circumcis@@ ion were observed .
with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended dos@@ ages there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurring at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ it@@ ated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous aff@@ ections used for the treatment of external co@@ wards in the genital and peripher@@ al area , no clinical experiences have been present until now .
although limited data refers to an increased rate of incl@@ ine re@@ ductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group regarding the elimination of the co@@ wards .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment interval can be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data is available for long term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s no clinical experience is available , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ ots .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ical spots outside the face and sc@@ alp .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take off in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
the data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons have a lower total cure rate than patients with fewer than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after one @-@ time nor after multiple top@@ ical application were achieved quanti@@ fiable levels of ser@@ um ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly communicated and possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in context @-@ related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of co@@ wards ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most frequently reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include dis@@ comfort at the application location with a inci@@ dence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III clinical trial were shown below .
the most common , as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects , were in these studies a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
side effects identified by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream were listed below .
this review of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / Ab@@ schu@@ ppen ( 23 % ) and O@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this review of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , severe Er@@ y@@ them@@ ums ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and c@@ rest ( 19 % ) came .
in clinical trials to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the Akt@@ inian ker@@ at@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental admission of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could result in nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous liquid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , system@@ ic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the co@@ wards during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment has been clearly superior .
in 60 % of the total 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od the co@@ wards healed completely ; this was the case of 20 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , versus 5 % of 161 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 79.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all patients treated clin@@ ically were cured and that remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the hair@@ less sc@@ alp or face .
the two @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical decay after one or two treatment periods .
in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , the approved indic@@ ations@@ of external co@@ ward war@@ ts , n@@ ude and super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not normally arise and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks and respectively ) .
a minimal system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in three times weekly use during 16 weeks .
the highest dosage concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) , on the sc@@ alp ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the half @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ delicate bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal tox@@ icity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ lim@@ eter weight ; a study of the der@@ mal application , which was conducted for four months , did not produce similar effects .
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice with mal@@ ign@@ ant administration on three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for humans to look very low due to the system@@ ic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the eff@@ lu@@ ent cream before and in greater number than in the control group with low UV@@ R .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dose I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements more difficult , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lo@@ wered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over 5 years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement range of lung function ) , Tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ v@@ ae or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will check all new information that may be disclosed every year , which may be known , and where necessary to update this summary .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me manufactures patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit for the allocation of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the whole European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cells ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese hamster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dose I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient transfers this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting in which re@@ vit@@ alisation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the phase 3 clinical trial , almost all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ yn@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months starting from the start of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ tious due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity .
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until symptoms have decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the inf@@ usion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate at which the preceding reaction has occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time using chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of lar@@ yn@@ id@@ ase .
animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to the mother &apos;s milk over mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to not satisfy al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 and over , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions arose , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respiratory and facial o@@ ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with a predominantly severe running form and a treatment time of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , with a he@@ avier exp@@ ir@@ ation of the patients during the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to detect antibodies using radio@@ immun@@ op@@ ul@@ c@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients in which it had never occurred to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ yn@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire range of disease , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) each week ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the vi@@ ability shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically non @-@ clinical over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of the body .
from the 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was observed in the urine ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease manifest@@ ations between the patients , which were taken into account by using a combined final point , the clin@@ ically significant overall FE@@ V ( predict@@ able percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
an open phase 2 study was conducted in which Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me &apos;s safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe displac@@ ement form and 4 with the mean run @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased Gag@@ - Mir@@ rors in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth was observed ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group . the younger patients with the severe course form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean run form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas older patients with severe course of decay were only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage regim@@ ens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage regim@@ ens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .

in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have performed a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
a inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the cell epithel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and get inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ( drugs against v@@ om@@ iting ) and flu@@ ids should be given before or after cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood picture changes or where certain other side effects occur , treatment should be postpon@@ ed , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slo@@ ws the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier to fur@@ nish in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ a compared with the compar@@ ative medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union .
every pier@@ cing bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % of the sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ wie@@ v plate epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with a radi@@ cally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma except for out@@ weighing of epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after preceding chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed @-@ Gabe , and on the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients also need an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1,000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after each third cycle of action .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood picture should be created before each dose , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ an@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose over@@ examination must take place under consideration - satur@@ ation of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predicted therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value of treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of dose , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the inci@@ dence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above compared to patients aged 65 years , there is an increased side effect risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to not sufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not require dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - bor@@ der@@ line and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone disease supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ roph@@ ils count once again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - zy@@ te count once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ roph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in previous cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid simultaneous in@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients en@@ vis@@ aged for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , in which these events occ@@ ured , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ du@@ p in trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment should be sur@@ vey@@ ed .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed when this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
given the possibility of irre@@ versible skull of the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be pointed out before the treatment guard to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tica ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) result in increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or a@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed are avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ i@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between or@@ ally anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ abl@@ ol@@ ites severe labour defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy unless necessary and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ versible damage to the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be pointed out before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ dens@@ ation .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby can not be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and which were random@@ ised Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ised Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

EM@@ PH@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin treated patients with a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month extended survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the normal cis@@ pl@@ a- tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms increased by improving lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration in lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ central , random@@ ized , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC was treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival fell to favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a mostly non @-@ plate epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data of a separate random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q Pop@@ ulation are consistent with the analysis of IT@@ T Pop@@ ulation and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of ALI@@ M@@ TA cis@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.2 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1,15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 33.@@ 9 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see the table below .
CI = Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a Statisti@@ cal significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total contrast of HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 645 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fusion ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ mb@@ al trans@@ fusion ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , patients needed the dose of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed after dosage as a mono@@ therapeutic drug were examined in inf@@ usions of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usions over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed is largely de@@ composed in urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found within 24 hours after the application remains unchanged in the urine .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney fun@@ tion ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , who had received intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , sti@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( de@@ gen@@ e- ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epithel@@ ial tissue ) .

it is used in over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take All@@ i and receive no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the diet , causing around a quarter of the fats in the diet un@@ th@@ a@@ wed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 391 over@@ weight patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg after a year showed an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss was observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ ing , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rang , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , Ab@@ gang ö@@ ligen ek@@ rets ( com@@ part@@ ments ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rep@@ ul@@ sion in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract ) or at chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) suffer , and in pregnant women or with lac@@ t@@ ating mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to inc@@ ur Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK in the entire European Union .
All@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fat @-@ reduced diet .
All@@ i may not be used by children and adol@@ escents under 18 , as there are not enough data on efficacy and safety .
however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take extra pregnant @-@ contrac@@ ted measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on the interactions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma is observed .
in the use of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international standard ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene remain in the normal range .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin consumption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time were observed a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not predict@@ able ) .
the inci@@ dence of known side effects identified after Or@@ list@@ at &apos;s market launch is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to conver@@ sions with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a quick reg@@ ression of any system@@ ic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at properties can be trac@@ ed .
the therapeutic effect is used in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine due to co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ suits .
clinical studies have been derived from the fact that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at is taken three times a day , which blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the dietary fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fat @-@ induced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( chart 1 ) and as part of those study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ est@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline factor 5,20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( 3,30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
in wa@@ ist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable for 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not yet metaboli@@ zed oral or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only spor@@ adi@@ c and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients , which administered the minimal system@@ ically res@@ or@@ ated dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects not specified in this use @-@ information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of capsules and are caused by ex@@ cre@@ ting fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may not have reduced the fat percentage in your diet at this time .
with the following principles you can learn to minimize the nutritional defici@@ encies : • Beg@@ inner a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ induced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fatty amount equal to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a durable hin@@ d@@ ess , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep medicine for children in@@ accessible . • You may not use all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The container is firmly sealed to protect the content from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .

over@@ weight has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Heart diseases • stroke • Cert@@ ain cancer • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for instance by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ jou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at a maximum per day .
see the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
which amount is suitable for you , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the mode of action of the capsule , adher@@ ence to recommended fat supply is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat supply , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional defici@@ encies . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose weight about 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not go on stairs every day , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 kcal per day , e.g. by 3 km walk , 30 - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to ad@@ here to them . • Sinn@@ ers is a food diary with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat @-@ du@@ ces and give guidelines to become physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the addition of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
this means that the active substance ret@@ ains the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens which are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission announced its approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to canc@@ ers and for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to canc@@ ers .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thickness of the col@@ on , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend Q@@ T interval or in patients whose Q@@ t- inter@@ v@@ all is extended or which tend to be prolong@@ ing such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used to prevent or treat nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs directed against tum@@ ours ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous dosage of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 indu@@ ctors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences of using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ation do not occur , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) were observed in clinical trials ( 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least likely associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the performance ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar inci@@ dents of adverse events , as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cis@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mcg of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7,@@ 3 hours ) were given , which was given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0,75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentrations time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally in the entire dose area of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg for individuals and cancer patients .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ k@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total tex@@ tured ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the single release of 0.75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kid@@ neys and another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in vit@@ ro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of results , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver function disturb@@ ances the terminal Eli@@ mination inhibit@@ or and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are elevated , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures which are considered sufficient for the maximum human@@ ist exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of pre@@ clinical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block I@@ onian channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30 @-@ times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , epi@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is destined for a single application , the relevance of these results is very low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recomm@@ ending the approval of the allocation of medicines intended for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C by al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million I@@ U / ml inj@@ ections .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same veter@@ an effective component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) h@@ epatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic analysis , the liver tissue damage damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are ab@@ normal in the blood ab@@ norm@@ ality .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon specified data showing the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study of h@@ epatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor on 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted will not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with h@@ epatitis C , which responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease r@@ ammed with more patients than in the case of a reference doctor ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study was not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mary ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven to be det@@ ectable or possibly caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface to be treated is not more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cle@@ ans@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ asser , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( iron @-@ filled c@@ avi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions or stit@@ ched wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. for the allocation of al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and be considered an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tiz@@ ing or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will begin .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary infected wounds the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected area occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of retin@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on sh@@ red@@ ded skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous oral dosage of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sh@@ red@@ ded skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients dose adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical retin@@ opathy is used during system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown re@@ productive tox@@ icity after oral in@@ gest@@ ation and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / ended , between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman should be weak@@ ened .
in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go have used , the most frequently reported side effect irrit@@ ation was at the meeting place , which considered about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of retin@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding points of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ ome protein L3 is involved and located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ dungs@@ stelle and Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partially block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appear question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences found in the in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin over S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us should be considered the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be has been applied daily under oc@@ cl@@ usion to intact and on shiel@@ ded skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic reception on humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ nu@@ b skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · H / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .
metabolism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low involvement of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vit@@ ro review on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ h oma test or in cultures of human peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study at rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development aid ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity .

after applying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ ever@@ band unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ine that is made out of two doses , whereby a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
this is why Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection during the imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the ino@@ cul@@ ation plan can be put to an end from two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose for h@@ epatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another h@@ epatitis A or B vacc@@ ine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by helping the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defence ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the registered vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix grown since 1996 and the since 1997 approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however Twin@@ Star adults and Twin@@ Star children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ine consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ Star adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ Star adults are also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain on the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ur@@ ability ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals .
the standardi@@ zation plan for basic compo@@ unding with Ambi@@ rix consists of two ino@@ cul@@ ation doses , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) vacc@@ ines are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully ensured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals , who have addressed a h@@ epatitis A vacc@@ ine , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 . for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the dose of the vacc@@ ine , the corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended using the combination vacc@@ ine , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs are reached after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the offering of further vacc@@ inations may be required .
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact failure , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular administration to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined meas@@ ure@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rab@@ bit vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive defects must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the inci@@ dence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ur@@ ality , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever is comparable to the inci@@ dence that was observed in earlier thi@@ ag@@ ulation and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ esi@@ osis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 50.@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine .
after the complete vacc@@ ine , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects that had received Ambi@@ rix reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 dose combination vacc@@ ine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to prob@@ ands per sample ( i.e. , over the entire vacc@@ ine cycle at 39,@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to those observed after the combination of the combination vacc@@ ine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reported .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ine with ambient or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ine with the combination @-@ in combination with 360 ELI@@ SA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ Converter rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ Converter rates for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard vacc@@ ine with three cans .
the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against h@@ epatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 dose vacc@@ ine were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ ity responses , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ine with ambient rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs can be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine .
the immune response observed in this study was similar to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vacc@@ ine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs are comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine scheme compared to the in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ine scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ ure@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rab@@ bit vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ vo conver@@ sions as for earlier formulation .
the vacc@@ ine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physi@@ co@@ ally visible changes .

the h@@ epatitis A virus is usually transmitted by means of viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other path@@ ways such as bathing in de@@ hydr@@ ated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lo@@ wish ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against an infection with h@@ epatitis B or h@@ epatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B virus before the administration of both Lyme disease or h@@ epatitis B virus ( although you / your child feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after h@@ epatitis B or h@@ epatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ ching r@@ ashes , respiratory or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly protect h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ine ) .
at a possible risk of h@@ epatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ epatitis A / h@@ epatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ine dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give your child a vacc@@ ination before termination of the vacc@@ ine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has received / has received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future .
it may be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will still be sufficient .
usually , am@@ il@@ itary or nursing women are not administered unless they are vacc@@ inated against h@@ epatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the appointment scheduled for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 transplan@@ ted doses ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at the in@@ sti@@ ch@@ ment or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ching • Rei@@ z@@ ability • head@@ ache • appetite deficiency
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 transplan@@ ted doses ) : • sw@@ elling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Happ@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal ail@@ ments
other side effects that have been reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 transplan@@ ted doses ) are :
these include local limited or extended r@@ ashes that can be it@@ chy or can be bub@@ ble @-@ shaped , sw@@ elling of the eye @-@ part and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lo@@ wing , sudden blood pressure loss and un@@ consciousness .

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child will greatly imp@@ air or you notice side effects not specified in this packing example .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP opinion assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix has only been placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ eed can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain compensation as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ eed is - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered by Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al @-@ onde ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study because Am@@ mon@@ eed did not compare with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without an active ingredient ) .
Am@@ mon@@ eed can also result in loss of appetite , ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , v@@ om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , r@@ ash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ eed in patients with disturb@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle was effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ eed was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , there is an indication for the use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy is in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form .
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development of the patient .
according to the clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as for adol@@ escents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthesis or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ OX@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with mon@@ stro@@ us retention and ede@@ ma , AM@@ OX@@ PS should be used only with care .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ af@@ y@@ yr@@ at over the liver and kid@@ neys is performed , AM@@ OX@@ PS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ ERI@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slo@@ wing of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed accumulation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ OX@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ OX@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ OX@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ OX@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oz@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms start with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys .
poles are phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced for each gram of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest@@ o @-@ manifest@@ ing form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms of new@@ born was almost always inf@@ ectious , and the disease itself led to death even when dealing with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ sul@@ fate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ers at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first months of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was with time with many intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic shape of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and afterwards treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ af@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible in treatment and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ i@@ dised to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kid@@ neys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at found .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycle disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis who were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ af@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma bar were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no concl@@ usive effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses .
AM@@ ERI@@ PS Gran@@ ules are taken either or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , which can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of over 20 kg as well as for adol@@ escents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthesis or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ ERI@@ PS Gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there were l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the cer@@ eb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ OX@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oz@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
poles are phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ated glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ulate form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ on contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication using a probe , AM@@ OX@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen containing waste products , which accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if you do lab tests , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ ERI@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ OX@@ PS with other medicines please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ ERI@@ PS as the medicine can pass into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturb@@ ances , dis@@ appearance of hearing , dis@@ oriented , memory disturb@@ ances and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or with the emergency stop of your hospital for initi@@ ating a corresponding treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

31 • App@@ ly from the container a he@@ aped measuring spo@@ on gran@@ ulate . • St@@ ay a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the edge of the knife to remove surplus gran@@ ules . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spo@@ on corresponds to a measuring spo@@ on .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ gone a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators , except for severe bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as with people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox inj@@ ections throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ arkt ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) during an emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion will be increased for the duration of the surgery to 1,75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be res@@ um@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous enc@@ ore of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ some bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ con@@ stituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully bl@@ ended before the application and the bol@@ us dose is administered promptly intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with severe kidney function restrictions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ valent studies against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose again .
in patients with severe kidney damage included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment during an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after ending the intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular forces .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other ingredient or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disorder of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or irre@@ versible ger@@ m disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis .
patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is administered in combination with other anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though in case of bi@@ val@@ rous studies , most ble@@ edings can occur at arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) while the treatment is in principle everywhere bleeding .
in patients taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ i@@ udi@@ n , monitoring the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is again the level achieved prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ates ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bic@@ ol@@ ir@@ udi@@ n with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te units or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ parameters in each case are regularly checked .
the experimental studies are in@@ adequate in relation to effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the retention or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n alone , 4@@ 604 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 603 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir group and the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age are more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or bleeding in the point range , hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 5 cm / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror , re@@ constructive surgery due to bleeding , using blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood@@ lines occ@@ ured at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects is based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n at 6000 patients who have under@@ gone a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir group and the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age are more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the compar@@ ative group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are classified according to system categories in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir udi@@ n , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and in the ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ valent in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is re@@ versible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on the other hand , spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ira was unable to indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ cted th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ zier@@ es Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose Syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .

if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was given according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ arkt ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or on the PCI .
in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were ev@@ enly distributed over the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or elevated cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ gone angi@@ ography within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ escents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the upper thig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a continuous inf@@ usion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or not to process insulin effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from the insulin analog , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of active life than a short @-@ acting Human@@ insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been used in combination with long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body is unable to produce insulin , in two trials involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where insulin is not able to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in insulin resistance compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can impact blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the thig@@ h or the del@@ to@@ id or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function .
any change of the active force , the brand ( her@@ - regul@@ ator ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be conducted under strict physician supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effect of the insulin used and can therefore change in changing the scheme .
the substances that increase the blood sugar lo@@ wered activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disc@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ en , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weak@@ ened or ab@@ sent under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reserves .
animal studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity showed no difference between intra@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin bo@@ li@@ sin enters human breast milk , but in general insulin is neither absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk nor is it res@@ or@@ b@@ ated after oral use .

pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y is fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection cavity within the injection range , as a result of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropriate person or treated by a doctor due to intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of glucose .
after glu@@ ca@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripher@@ al glucose ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin the effect of action takes place faster and the duration of active patients is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 , insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional glu@@ cos@@ es@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ al effect , just like Human@@ insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast effect as the normal human insulin analog and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal has reached a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was inj@@ ected 2 minutes before the meal , achieved better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved like with human normal insulin , which is given 2 minutes before meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin by 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - before ) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - 30 min . ) prior to the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin after 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - after@@ ward ) after the start of the meal compared to human northern paint insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
