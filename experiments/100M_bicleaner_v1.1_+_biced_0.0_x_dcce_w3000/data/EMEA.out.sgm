<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Research Report (EPAR), which is explained how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the conducted studies in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please refer to the package sample (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. verres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of anormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to inhale or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably primarily acts as a "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol acts like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing mental or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the recurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection Solution was compared in 301 patients with bipolar disorder caused by increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment was examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbs the enamel tablets and the solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">While applying to treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of some episodes in previously treated patients as placebo for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale disorders (uncontrolled), tremor (dizzy), fatigue, nausea (nausea), fatigue, nausea (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, and in preventing a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were responding to the treatment with Aripiprazol, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission approved Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for Abilify inroads across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and discussed their manic episodes on the treatment with aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The incidence of suicidal behavior belongs to mental disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no higher risk of suicide with aripiprazole compared to other anti-psychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbance), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are prescribed for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including a cell-treated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">When patients treat symptoms and symptoms of a late dysentinesia with Abilify, consider reducing the dose or cancelling the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all anti-psychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacitin or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsia, polyurium, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes Mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of aripiprazol on the central nervous system caution is advisable if Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-acting drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically non-relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased AUC by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reduction should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism can result in the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should prevail over the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitoren, have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reduction should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, Abilify dosage should be lifted to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for human security and, due to the concerns raised in animal reproduction, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occured more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below depends on the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients with oslanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine-controlled laboratory parameters emerged, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The adverse events reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence also in the treatment with Aripiprazol, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and convulsions, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes Mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or intentional overdosages with aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death succession.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosing with aripiprazole, however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is of benefit in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazol has high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I interferes on the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as an even affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the dosage of Aripiprazol in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, by the nucleus caudatus and at the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the share of responder patients who considered a response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg- depression rates scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an oblanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study potential 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible dosage of 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy against placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without mental features, Aripiprazol presented a week 3 efficacy against placebo, which was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Additionally, in week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without mental features, which partly did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension of over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazol was thinking about the prevention of a bipolar setback, mainly in preventing a reversal in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyde of aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle elimination of eliminate is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol in extensive metabsants via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and there were no sexually dependent effects in a pharmakokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different radiant liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the potential potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependant adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the mean Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3 times the average Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81pples of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human genus at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydroxy- aripiprazole are no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosage, which led to expositions of the mid-Steady-State AUC during the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase resorption and to minimize variability, injection is recommended in the deltoid muscle or deep into gluteus maximus muscle under circumscription of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status considering the medicine used for maintenance or Akut therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an additional oral treatment is indicated with aripiprazol, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazol injection in patients with Agieness and behavioural dysfunctions caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme distress or blood pressure (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribing or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbance), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are prescribed for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including a cell-treated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyspinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS include high fever, muscle rigidity, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsia, polyurium, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar manic due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared with that of Aripiprazol, in a study, in healthy volunteers aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was used as a disposable intramuscular one and which simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically non-relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitoren, have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reduction should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, Abilify dosage should be lifted to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared with that after sole administration of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events occured in clinical trials with Aripiprazol injection solution more often (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below depends on the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events occured more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo, or were classified in clinical trials involving orally relevant aripiprazole as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine-controlled laboratory parameters emerged, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The adverse events reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence also in the treatment with Aripiprazol, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and convulsions, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazol injection solution with statistically significant major improvements of Agieness / behavioural dysfunctions associated with placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as Agieness and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in symptoms regarding the Agieness and behavioural disturbances in comparison with placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The average improvement observed on the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe attilization, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) compared to placebo showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the share of responder patients who considered a response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an oblanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study potential 'weight gain' was, in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without mental features, which partly did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension for manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazol was thinking about the prevention of a bipolar setback, mainly in preventing a reversal in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection. the systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers lay the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated gift during a systemic exposure (AUC), which lay 15- or 5 times above the maximum humanist exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity according to intravenous application, no safety-relevant concerns arose after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) about the maximum humanist exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the potential potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; thus, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependant adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the average dose-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average dose-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosage, which led to expositions of 3 and 11-fold the mean-state AUC during the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a main study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated, about three quarters earlier an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration and as monotherapy) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer have no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time and worsening of disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer were in relation to these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective in patients whose first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs, and that unlike other paclitaxel drugs, drugs do not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">January 2008, the European Commission approved the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the transport of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where first-line treatment for metastatic disease is not shown and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">For sensorial neuropathy grade 3, the treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached at Grade 1 or 2, and the dosage must be reduced in all subsequent cycles.</seg>

<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (frequent) that can affect traffic and ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events occurring in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, which were treated in the pivotal phase III trial every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most striking important haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported to 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with Abraxane gift as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactine hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorous in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue-burning, dry mouth, painless gums, loose stool, ecotophilitis, soreness in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, headache, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flange-pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in context in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules that promotes the migrating of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting its dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cellular functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60-albuman receptor and occurs due to the albumbinding protein particles SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two unanimous unverbal studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion with premedication to the contraception of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a negative general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasation and 19% because of metastasation and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the ending on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Active ingredient exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous dose of abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration increased in a multi-phase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean volume of distribution was 632 l / m2; the high volume of distribution points to a far-reaching exorascular distribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane dosage (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine secretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that bottamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood loss is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician, who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation, Abbotamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be done by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have obtained an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobin should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults respectively between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients are to be controlled prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus diminish the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been produced that enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to an injection into a vein as part of a major study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused anemia, compared to the reference doctor.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they were either converted to seamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of secretion under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy alone.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, the hemoglobin levels of patients who were renamed to Abseamed were maintained in the same degree as for those who still received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, the patients who still received an Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the baseline value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing, migraine headache and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Bottamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the provisions of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which manufactures Abseamed, will provide information packages for the medical personnel in all member states, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger operative interventions, which require a large blood volume set (4 or more units of blood for men; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7,5 mmol / l) except for paediatric patients, where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in one patient over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for controlling anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.E. / kg three times a week using intravenous application if necessary with an increase in dose of 25 I.E. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for controlling the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of the hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticuloid number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticuloid number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticuloid rate by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained three times a week by 300 I.E. / kg.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the hemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood convae is required, Abbotamed should receive a weight of 600 I.E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the seamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each successive days, on the day of the surgery, as well as 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who are suffering from a erythropoetin in a erythroblastminie (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - Erythroblastopenie).</seg>

<seg id="409">In patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthopedic procedure and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, voicular or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurring cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the appearance of a mediated PRCA after months and years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effect, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of a non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiums, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anemia (i.e. the precariulocyte "index"), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0,5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone conduit to the diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of seamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the maximum limit of hemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit due to epoetines, when the hemoglobin concentration is elevated above the concentration needed to control the anemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidence of coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under section 4.2, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings by the treatment of anemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, the progression of renal insufficiency is not accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">For the evaluation of epoetin alfa therapy efficiency, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa administration and erythropoietin response should be taken into account (patients who may need to be transmed) for the evaluation of epoetin alfa therapy efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - Dosage adjustments with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing system involving the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthopedic procedure, if possible, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly prior to the onset of epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopedic procedure should receive appropriate thromboseprophylaxis as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that for treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>

<seg id="562">Erythroblastopenie means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see section "Special Care in the Application of Abseamed is required").</seg>
<seg id="563">After repeated blood donors it can happen - regardless of the treatment with Abseamed - to a blood plaque (thrombotic vascular events).</seg>
<seg id="564">The treatment with Abseamed can be associated with an increased risk of blood prosthesis after surgery (postoperative thrombotic vascular events) if your output level is too high</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high risk of fractures (bone fractures), including patients who have recently suffered a minor offence as in the case of hepatitis; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium per day for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) oral or by injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (means of inflammation) just after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta must be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for Zometa was used to evaluate Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, almost 80,000 older women were involved with osteoporosis and the number of spine and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip fracture; it was investigated the number of fractures over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decreases bone substance) in the blood once more normalized or decreased by at least 75% vis-à-vis the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of vertebrate fractures in patients under Aclasta (without any other osteoporosis treatment) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis treatment) with those under placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclause had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most adverse events of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonate patients, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion centre and osteonekloss (the death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information material for doctors that prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains indications of how to apply the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited a permit for the transportation of Aclasta across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • The treatment plant • contraindication in pregnancy and with breastfeeding women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When medical or nursing aid is accessed</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with morbus Paget sufficient intake of calcium, corresponding to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initialdose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.E. orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen just after using Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunctions (see section 4.4) In patients with a Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) Dosage adjustments are not necessary, as bioavailability, distribution and elimination are similar to older patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents from Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data are missing for harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of the treatment (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the quick insertion of the effect of zoledronic acid on bone structure, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with morbus Paget sufficient intake of calcium, corresponding to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancers, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, bad oral hygiene should be induced prior to an application of bisphosphonate treatment with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental procedures, no data is available if the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonate reduces the risk of osteonecroses in the jaw region.</seg>
<seg id="605">Clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen just after using Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">Incidence of severe side effects reported by atrial fibrillation was increased in patients who received Aclause (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0,6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) undesirable drug effects are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic was associated with renal dysfunctions, which are associated with a decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as absolute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of the serum creatine in 10 days of the dose was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclause compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium-values, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2,10 mmol / l), were treated at 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures following a recently suffered hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the jaw region became knowingly, particularly in cancer patients, about osteonekrosen (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonate, including zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteoporosis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients showed osteonekloss in the jaw area in a patient diagnosed with Aclasta and a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdosing, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2,5 with or without signs of an existing fluidized body tincture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebrate fractures Aclasta sensed significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new vertebrate fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk for vertebrate fractures compared with placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar linoleic acid, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 increase in bone density of lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the thigh hals by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In the case of 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic cavity were taken.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputerised (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume in comparison with placebo, and the retention of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in peripheral intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclause reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.E. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased compared to placebo treatment by BMD at the total hip and thigh hals at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclumsy treatment led to an increase in the BMD by 5.4% in the total hip and by 4.3% on the Schenkelhals over a period of 24 months compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclause-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once-weekly administration of Aclasta was compared to the once-weekly administration of alendronate related to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta has been studied in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically proven, especially light to moderate weight morbus paget of the bone (mean serum mirrors of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with 2.6ples of age-specific upper normal value when taken into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Risedronate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month study (responded to therapy) could be included in an observational phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and 107 with Risedronat patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response in 141 of patients treated with Aclasta compared with 71 patients treated with Risedronat will be maintained at a mean duration of the observational period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dosed independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the highest value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase disappearance from the big cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination of the elimination of ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid absorption in bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zinc acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased clearance of metabolic substances by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely, because it is not yet metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledron Acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 studied patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and regular renal dysfunction down to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe renal dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose was in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6times of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal compatibility of zoledronic acid was given in rats by dosed doses of 0.6mg / kg in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the seven-times human-therapeutic exposure related to AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in eculized expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the planned human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and the intravenous injection point were performed.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyse of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses, an infestation that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to reduced serum calcium.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not immediately used, the user is responsible for the preparation and conditions before the application; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a substance class that is called bisphosphonate, and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the morbus paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">At Morbus Paget the bone structure takes place too quickly, and new bone material is unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by restoring the bone structure again, ensuring a normal bone formation and therefore gives the bone strength again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">Use Aclasta with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist or care staff if you use / apply other medicines and / or have used it recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs from which it is known that they damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and drink, make sure that you take sufficient liquid in accordance with your doctor's instructions before and after treatment with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="679">Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion into a vein.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg, administered by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclasta looks for a long time, you may need another dose after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclasta has been missed, contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before ending the treatment with Aclasta Falls you are considering ending the treatment with Aclasta, please take your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion are very common (with more than 30% of patients), but are less common after infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain, and headache, occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public. this document is a summary of the European Public Research Report (EPAR), which is explained how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the conducted studies in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can additionally be applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), which can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonic acid or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl resins and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulfonyl resins and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops, whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos was studied in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin in lowering the HbA1c values was 0.94% while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who Actos additionally took insulin, reduced HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypogetic (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos in a monotherapy (at the sole use) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission approved Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white until whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marker" 15 "" "" and on the other hand the inscription "" "" ACTOS "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macerascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated liver enzymers (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror increases to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzymers are checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction like e.g. unexplained nausea, vomiting, overbauchment, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymers are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon should be conducted by the clinical assessment to the extent of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain was detected, which can be due to fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution in the treatment with Pioglitazon, a slight reduction of mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglitazone by 3-4% and hematoma (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%) in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglitazone by 1-2%) and hematokrits (1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, the pioglitazone can be used as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyl resin or as a two-way combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependant hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under the treatment with thiazolidindia, including Pioglitazon, about a occurrence or a deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but distressing physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated Fraktur incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive Study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or occurs, the treatment is to be canceled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacokinetics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in lower AUC by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia developed during pregnancy and increased insulin resistance to the mother animal can be reduced and reduced the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not invaluable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT ascents above three times the upper limit of the standard range also frequently occur as below placebo, but less rarely than in comparison groups under Metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe congestive heart failure was 1.6% higher than under placebo, if pioglitazone resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often, if pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies spanning a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazon and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive Study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose load in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is refuted (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of the therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite the three-month optimisation period with insulin, were randomised to pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotient in clinical trials compared to the baseline values was observed in Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in the total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slight but clinically non-significant LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced in comparison to placebo, metformin or gliclazide the total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel in Pioglitazon, while Metformin and Gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the genders triglycerides, but also improved the post-cordial increased triglyceride level, this has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive Study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either Pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, whereby the top concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy in approximately the triple the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacokinetics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (Cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After orally application of radioactive marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in waste (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination of unmodified pioglitazon amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance resemble themselves.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicology studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys consistent after repeated administration of plasma volume augmentation with hemodilution, anemia and reversible excentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulinemia developed in gestation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal can be reduced and reduced the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidences of hyperplasia (with male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) of the urethral epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolid indices led to increased incidence of colontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marker "30" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated Fraktur incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive Study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, there was a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotient in clinical trials compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the genders triglycerides, but also improved the post-cordial increased triglyceride level, this has an effect on Tryglyceride absorption as well as hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarct, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation upstream of the ankle, coronary reascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular risks associated with the intake of pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white until whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marker "45" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and of more than 7,400 patients who received comparative medication showed an increased incidence of bone fractures in women.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas does not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror which indicated that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the full list is to be found in the package sample).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane overlapped the risks of diabetes in relation to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the allocation of Actraphane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar level is significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy, hypoglycemia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, biphase, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA to insulin animal origin) can cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, where hypoglycaemic reactions occurring after switching from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which pass over several time zones, the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Sow hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in a non-controlled diabetes treatment, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit toes in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycaemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or cramps and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Actually - Periphere Neuropathy A rapid improvement of the blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort which are called acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement of blood sugar adjustment can, however, be associated with a temporary deterioration in diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Diseases of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue Actually - Lipodystrophy An der Injektionsstelle can develop a Lipodystrophy when failed to switch the incisions within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General diseases and discomfort at the location of money - Local Surprisal reaction to the injections during insulin therapy can occur local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Actually - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disturbances, angiotic oedema, breathing difficulty, low blood pressure and impotence / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugar-containing foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grapevine sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven help person or by glucose which is administered intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane piercing bottle was extracted from the fridge - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not over 25 ° C) before it is resuscitated in accordance with the user's instructions for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients, where hypoglycaemic reactions occurring after switching from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1020">How Actraphane looks and contents of the package The injection suspension will be delivered as a cloudy, white, watery suspension in packs of 5 or 10 finished pens, each with 3 ml each.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Before each injection • Check if at least 12 units of insulin are remaining in the cartridge, ensuring an even mix.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage: • Keep Actraphane 10 NovoLet with the injection needle up • knock a few times with your finger slightly against the cartridge.</seg>
<seg id="1023">If air bubbles are present, they will be collected at the top of the cartridge • While you continue to hold Actraphane 10 NovoRT with the injection needle, rotate the cartridge in the direction of the arrow (Figure C) • During the injection needle further down, press the pressure button in it (Figure D) • Now you have to exit a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle.</seg>
<seg id="1024">• Restore the cap again on the finished pen, that the number 0 stands opposite the dosing mark (Figure E) • Check if the press button is pressed completely.</seg>
<seg id="1025">If not, turn the cap until the press button is pressed completely • Keep your Actraphane 10 NovoLet horizontally.</seg>
<seg id="1026">If the pressure button cannot move freely to the outside, insulin is pressed from the injection needle • The scale on the closing cap shows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 units.</seg>
<seg id="1027">The press button moves outwards while you rotate the cap • The scale below the press button shows 20, 40 and 60 units.</seg>
<seg id="1028">Check a set dose • Notice the number on the cap directly next to the dosing mark • Notice the highest number you can see at the pressure button • If you have stopped a wrong dose, simply turn the cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Otherwise insulin is sprayed out of the injection needle and the recommended dose will not be correct • If you have tried to stop a dose of more than 78 units, take the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="1030">Then take the cap and reset it again so that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Make sure to press the pressure button only during the injection. • Keep the pressure button after the injection completely down until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="1032">If not, turn the cap until the press button is pressed completely and then proceed as described in before use • Can you hear a clickable noise when pushing the button.</seg>
<seg id="1033">It may be inaccurate • You can't set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remainder scale to estimate how much insulin is still remaining.</seg>

<seg id="1171">In the first study, in which 1 072 patients participated, the effectiveness of three different adenural dosages (once daily 80, 120 and 240 mg) was compared with the placebo (pseudo-medicaments) and Allopurinol (another medicine for the treatment of hyperuricemia).</seg>
<seg id="1172">In the second study two doses of adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared to 762 patients each year with Allopurinol.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies Allopurinol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose uric acid levels in the blood lay in the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first trial 48% (126 of 262) of patients received 80 mg once daily, and 65% (175 of 269) of the patients taking 120 mg once daily, with the last three measurements a uric acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">Compared to this, this was 22% (60 of 268) of the patients under Allopurinol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of adenuric (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with heart problems in prehistory, there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than Allopurinol, but there could also be a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in serum acid levels increased to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed treatment against a gout delay in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of the patients required no treatment for a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the gout node size, resulting in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the gout nodes by month 24.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which transplantation was rejected after a year of treatment (for example, investigating how often a renewed organ transplant or re-absorption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level provisions (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus-Talks should be checked before switching and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as tallow levels, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate re-transplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendation - kidney transplantation Prophylaxis of the graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments can be later required, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendation - liver transplant prophylaxis of the graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dose recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a transplant receptor of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules at once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to be done in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a transition from other immunosuppressive agents on Advagraf once daily, the treatment with the oral initialdosis recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin for prophylaxis of the graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are converted to Advagraf, an oral initialdose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receptors, although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf at lungen-, pankreas- and colorectal transplanted patients, in an oral initialdosis of 0,2 mg / kg / day, in case of pankreastransplaned patients in an oral initialdosis of 0,3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may be necessary for patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Because kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum cancer levels, a calculation of the creatinins and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is recommended (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the level of blood in whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases under the aid of full blood Tacrolimus-Talmirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent inspections of the tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosage adjustments, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances that could change the tacrolimus-whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood level of tacrolimus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney and heart transplant patients, blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur in consequence of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has proven to be refractory against other immunosuppressive agents, no clinical data is available for the retardated formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant receivers and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data are available for the retardated formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a degradation of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the currant (hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered because the tacrolimus levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septum hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which therefore can also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid transfer and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressive agents, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since advagraf hard capsules, retardated, lactose contain, there are special caution in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is recommended that the Tacrolimus- blood levels at the same dose of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolic change and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations accordingly (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV proteastics (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly due to the elevated oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly-dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with drugs can be metabolized by CYP3A4 whose metabolism affects.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone exposure, decisions about contraceptive action must be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially decrease the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and prolong their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In the utero exposure a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and hyperactivity of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours associated with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects on molecular level are likely to be conveyed by the effects of tacrolimus by its binding to a cytoslic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciument inhibition of signal transduction due to the T cell, thus preventing the transcription of a certain number of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies revealed observations in the major studies in which Prograf was used for liver, kidney and heart transplants for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis over a recently conducted, multicenter study with oral Prograf, more than 110 patients were reported, who received tacrolimus or Ciclosporin during a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplant rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Patients treated with Tacrolimus occurred in 21.7% of cases for the formation of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients killed by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases where there was no acute graft rejection was higher after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patient transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study the incidence of the development of a bronchiolitis obliteral syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multicentric trial with oral Prograf was performed to 205 patients who were simultaneously receiving a pancrease and kidney transplantation, which were randomised to receive a randomized procedure with tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdosis (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for achieving the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Bowel grafting The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral Prograf as primary immunosuppressant according to intestinal transplantations showed a current survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, additional dose of interleukin 2 antagonists Daclizumab, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to levels reflect between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently graft conversion (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unfounded fraction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism due to treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly done via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf for stable patients (once daily) at Advagraf (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advent is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advent is applied to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables them to form the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advent is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the medicine was investigated for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advent in prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septic periods was "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advent (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advent may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Baxter AG for the placing of Advent in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy are based on the severity of the VIII deficiency, after the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma concentrations (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat once every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, an appropriate determination of the factor VIII-plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, reach different in vivo recovery and have different half-value periods.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be dosed between 20 and 40 I.E. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by a proper dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not exceed 10 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma through modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 expositional days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposures and anamnesia known inhibitors, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (lower) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A for women there are no experiences concerning the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, which were occurring in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), who showed a higher risk to the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data not predictable).</seg>

<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VIII- Mirrors in the plasma and the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials involving ADVOC to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed difficult to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 expositional days (≥ 150 days).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed difficult to moderate hammophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor was established.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients with inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins has been analysed by investigating the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a prolonged peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of Urticaria, Pruritus, rash-rash and increased number of eosinophiler granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As for other intravenous products, over hypersensitivity reactions from the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (incidence not known) were reported.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits-risk weighing system as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, has decided to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited officially announced that the company resumes its application for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breasts, the brain, bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advantine is an "Adenovirus" which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and thus no infections can be solved in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient where Li-Fraumeni cancer occurred in the area of the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP tested the company's answers to the questions asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the documents submitted initially, the CHMP on Day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advantine in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advent can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform CHMP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerosze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by allergy to pollen, inflammation of the nasal pathways) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 years, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet which is to be taken with or without food altogether with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-mucosa (petrified nose), are abbreviated.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be refuted for constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main activity dimensions were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed using a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When looking at all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerosze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received Desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedycardia (heart chasing), mouth-dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), anorexia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">In patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadine (another drug used to treat allergies) is not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a tight angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroid), hyperthyrosis (stroke caused by stroke) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the allocation of Aerinaze to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however it is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decline in the swelling of mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with Desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors respectively within 2 weeks following the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, ergoamin, diihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be perally or nasal as a swelling rhinocerol (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of an aerosine were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment has to be removed in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a reinforcement of the headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, hydatid throat or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerosze is to be performed at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions on Indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Desloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratome were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with placebo and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vivo CYP3A4 not inhibited, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerosine during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, have no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the incidence of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictant properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosine should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness, which can lead to impairment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyansis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letteral trials.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, vachycardia, ptinnitus, respiratory, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouthdry, pupil rigidity and - dilation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion smolecüls P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an individual dose study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flux, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowiness compared to placebo was detected at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can evoke more sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the overall cores (except nasal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the diminishing effect, determined by the nasal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">Efficacy of carinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of an individual dose-study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratkin is detectable within 30 minutes after the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerosze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow balance was reached from Desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose therapy, which was performed with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) from Pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was for exposure according to an aerosze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadine does not recognize any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-risk studies, the combination of Loratadine / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in Module 1 8.1 of the application for authorisation, the pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance that can unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and drowning or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing, whistling breathing, itching, nettle rash and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach complaint, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, numbness, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of eye-catching liver data has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilia (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml-solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children from six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving some 4800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrolas, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body uses the syrup, the solution to inhale and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom (symptom number) by 25 to 32%, compared to decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria, the decrease in symptoms after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadine, Loratadine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit for the company to transport Aerius in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Desloratkin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous illness and may be resumed after the symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persistent allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) the patient may be recommended during the allergy-time a continuing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Desloratine tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, while using Aerius and alcohol, the impending effect of alcohol was not amplified (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which can lead to impairment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side effects reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), mouth-dry (0,8%) and headaches (0,6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 adolescents from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, which was treated with 5.9% of patients treated with the macabadine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multiple dose study administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadine (nine times clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion smolecüls P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses, in the Desloratessen in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the Desloratine administered at a dose of 45 mg a day (the nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose-study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gliding, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear-flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified as alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall cores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal acrhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was studied for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be easily recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine replacement is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that Desloratadine is also leading to an improvement in symptoms even in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of spindles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itching around more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disorder of sleep and vigilance significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which the patient demoographies were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients had reached a higher concentration of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after once daily application of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo, not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratine in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-calorie breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of Desloratadine and Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratkin can not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius may be taken regardless of meals, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise Desloratadine and experience higher concentration levels (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, which metabolizes limited is identical to that in children who metabolise normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients should not use hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or a saccharase isomaltase- insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, simultaneous intake of Aerius tablets and alcohol did not amplify the performance of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group, similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius were reported in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadine (nine times clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for antihistamine therapy received a daily Desloratadindosis of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the progression of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadine in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratkin can be extrapoliated in adults on the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the Desloratessen in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratessen in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval did not appear.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents conducted clinical studies on no impairment of the psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not cause a strengthening of alcohol-induced impairment and an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear-flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the overall cores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively decrease the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of spindles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted phenotype was similar in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in chewing gum (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with syrup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which can be restricted.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The burden (AUC) by Desloratadin was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications of clinically relevant drug accumulation once daily application of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies showed that AUC- and CMAx values of Desloratine were comparable to the recommended doses with those of adults who received the Desloratine syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1886">After the market launch of Aerius, it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) and rash.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Aerius solution to collect is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years, teenagers (12 years and older) and adults, older people included.</seg>
<seg id="1888">If the solution for inhaling an application syringe for preparations for inhaling with scaling is included, you can use it alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1889">Regarding the treatment duration your doctor will determine the type of allergic rhinitis that you suffer and will determine how long you should take Aerius solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="1890">However, in children under 2 years of diarrhea, fever and sleeplessness there were frequent side effects while in adults fatigue, mouth-dry and headache have been reported more often than with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1891">97 Aerius solution for intake is available in bottles with a safe cap with 30, 50, 60, 100, 120, 150, 225 and 300 ml.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced that the company withdraws its application for approval for the transport of Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges, which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as "physically alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This means that the immune system will later be able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane hull of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognises as a foreign body) was disconnected, stoned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the extent of the clinical data basis for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are participating in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for use, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood that the virus is addressed to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agenera depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Asgenerase reduces the HIV levels in the blood when combined with other antiviral drugs and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral agents, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with proteastics.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low-dose Ritonavir increased drug Agenerase was compared with 206 adults who used to protease inhibitors, compared with other proteastics.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with unproven concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml under placebo after 48 weeks, but agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also decreased the viral load, but only very few of the children who had been treated with protease inhibitors were very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug used with Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase with Ritonavir to a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared with the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (nausea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the Johanniskraut (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines which are just like agenerase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonnecrosis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reaction syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of agenerics in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not have proteasants have not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "agenerase was originally" "" "approved" "" "under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit for Glaxo Group Limited for the allocation of agenera in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pretreated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, agenase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic boosting of amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% less than of amprenavir as capsule; therefore, agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram is not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If asgenerase capsules are used without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of agenase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agenerics combined with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to lack of data for harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice a day, based on pharmacokinetic data.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver function disturbance it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isocation 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements that contain Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that genase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with agenerase prevents the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, agenase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously restricted liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of agenera and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoids being metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteration effects including Morbus Cushing and suppressions of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of agenase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of Myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalised Ratio), methods are available for determining the active substance concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these medicines at the same time, agenerase may be less effective for amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is simultaneously given with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylenglycolein halts of the agenase solution to intake, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy drugs were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">At hemophiles patients (type A and B) treated with proteastics, reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemic throsis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of introducing an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonekloss were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isocation 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in AUC by amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the low plasma level by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often undesirable effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum mirrors by Amprenavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes Johanniskraut, the ammonium levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were applied twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment schematics.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humbled when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended a close-meshed surveillance since the efficacy and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmakokinetic study was performed in combination with didanosin, but due to the antacid component of Didanosin it is recommended that the receipts from Didanosin and agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would erlow.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may be lowered the concentration of the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used at the same time, caution is advisable since Delavirine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine is used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on delavirine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous dosage of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin around 193% and thus to a rise in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with agenerase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data exists.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with agenase in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but the plasma level of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and AUC (0-τ) to 2.69fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may, if applied together with agenera, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these drugs when used in combination with agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as agenerase since it can lead to resorption disruptions.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsions known as an enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a decrease of the plasma level of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine,</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and amplify with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg of Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dosage of agenera with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteration effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases of the plasma level are expected in concurrent administration of agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma level increases of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this drug with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased in the concurrent dose of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, agenera must not be used together with oral contraceptive midazolam (see section 4.3) while taking care of asgenera with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors point to a possible increase of the Midazolam plasma bar around the 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the slight negligence of historic comparisons, no recommendation is currently being given as the amprenavir dose is adjusted when amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agenerase, increased control of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended while using Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In milk lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances were detected, but it is not known whether amprenavir is passed in humans into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the nistung to the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight in the descendants during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the descendants, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of agenase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occured early and rarely led to treatment abortion.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are related to the use of agenase or another medicine used to treat HIV, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with proteastics did not receive 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fait subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral uncovered persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernack) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, patients treated 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients under indinavir, combined with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macular-optic nature, with or without itching and usually occured during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonekloss cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of introducing an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice daily along with low dose rideonavir (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed in patients who received agenerase along with low dose Ritonavir, very often occured.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processionation of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyproteins precursors with the consequence of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% HemmConcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir ranges from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with the currently approved Fosampravir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir imaging schemas with proteaseinhibitoren - the mutations described rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral unpretreated patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be studied in genotypically.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59, with proteastics of previously untreated patients, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, M36I, M46I / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I54L, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosampravir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with proteastics over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors occur:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing, genotypical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasformer resistent isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / C, L33F, M36I, I54A / L / M / S, I84V and L90M combined with an elevated phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir as well as a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">On phenotypic resistance testing based analyses clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypical data for assessing the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosampravir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasformer resistent isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (separations) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic samples creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between amprenavir and other proteastics for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral unpretreated patients (one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir to treatment start and another against Tipranavir), indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Lopinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasformer resistant isolates; the retention of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistor mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI pre-treated adults (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside catalog (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly sacrificed with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threandolder (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-subordination of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-lower threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of untreated Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, genase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients involved in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data, treatment optimisation should be considered with PI pre-treated children of the expected benefits of "unpoosterised" agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration the mean duration (Tmax) amounts to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of involuntary amprenavir which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active constituents fluctuates during dosing intervals in the Steady State over the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be taken with care if they are administered at the same time with agenerics (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, agenerase solution and agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regiments lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas were observed in male animals, which corresponded to the 2,0-fold (mice) or 3.8- fold (rat) of the exposure to humans, after twice daily offering of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutical applications, there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro-genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity may be monitored and proven in clinical life through the measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphate gases.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of agenera nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure under therapeutic dose in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If asgenerase capsules are used without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of agenase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with weak or light liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver function disturbance it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalised Ratio), methods are available for determining the active substance concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended a close-meshed surveillance since the efficacy and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would erlow.</seg>

<seg id="2174">The application frequency and duration of treatment with Aldara depend on the disease to be treated. • In case of case of cowards in the genital area, Aldara is up to a maximum of 16 weeks to apply three times a week. • In case of small basal cell carcinomas it is three times a week during one or two four-week treatment cycles, with four weeks of intermission between the treatment cycles, three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The cream is thin-layered before bedtime to apply thin layers to the affected skin areas so that it will remain in the skin for a long time (approximately eight hours) before being washed off.</seg>
<seg id="2176">In all studies Aldara was compared with a placebo (the same cream, but without the drug). • Aldara was tested in four main studies on 923 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks each.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated Warzen. • Aldara was also examined in 724 patients with small basal cell carcinomas in two studies, in which patients were treated for six weeks and Aldara or placebo applied either daily or five times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tumours after twelve weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with tin cans.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara was more effective than the placebo. • In the treatment of patients treated with placebo, the complete healing rate was 15% to 52% in patients treated with placebo. • The results of the two studies on basal cell carcinomas showed a complete treatment rate of 66% to 80% in the patients treated with Aldara compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="2180">The most common side effects of Aldara (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are reactions to the application of cream (pain or itching).</seg>
<seg id="2181">Clinically typical, not hypertrophic, not hypertrophic actuators (AKs) in the face or on the scalp in immunocompetent adults if the size or number of lesions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cryotherapy and other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less suitable.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Monday, Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday) apply before bedtime and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The treatment with Imiquimod cream is to continue until all visible cowards have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area, or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="2184">A break in the procedure described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur (see section 4.4) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area.</seg>
<seg id="2185">If follow-up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period, the treated lesions are only incompletely healed, another therapy should be started (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2186">When a dose has been omitted, the patient solves the cream once he / she notice it and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Imiquimod cream is applied in a thin layer and applied in the cleaned skin area infected with cowards until the cream is completely covered.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There should be a reduction in these patients between the benefits of treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with possible worsening of their autoimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="2189">There should be a reduction in these patients between the benefits of treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible organ repulsion or graft-versus-host response.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In other studies in which no daily pre-hassygiene was performed, two cases of severe phimosis and one case with a female circumcision were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2191">With an application of Imiquimod cream in higher than the recommended dosages there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation (see section 4.2.) In rare cases, severe local skin irritations were observed, which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurring at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, which necessitated emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">For the application of Imiquimod cream immediately following treatment with other cutaneous affections used for the treatment of external cowards in the genital and peripheral area, no clinical experiences have been present until now.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Although limited data refers to an increased rate of incline reductions in HIV positive patients, Imiquimod cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group regarding the elimination of the cowards.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips, or hairline was not studied.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common, but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment interval can be made several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since no data is available for long term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other suitable therapy forms should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs no clinical experience is available, therefore the application is not recommended for pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) a lower probability of response to Imiquimod therapy consists.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for treatment of acute keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lipots.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses on anatomical spots outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratsis on the forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually take off in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment can be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">The data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 ac- lesions have a lower total cure rate than patients with fewer than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be used with care in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither after one-time nor after multiple topical application were achieved quantifiable levels of serum (&gt; 5ng / ml), no recommendation can be given during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly communicated and possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in context-related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most frequently reported and probably or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream related side effects include discomfort at the application location with a incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Phase III clinical trial were shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, as probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in connection with side effects, were in these studies a response to the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Side effects identified by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimod cream were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This review of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod cream, it frequently came to local skin reactions including Erythema (61%), erosion (30%), Excoriation / Abschuppen (23%) and Odem (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This review of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream, severe Erythemums (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scarring and crest (19%) came.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials to investigate the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of the Aktinian keratsis, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental admission of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could result in nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotony, which normalized after oral or intravenous liquid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cowards during an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment has been clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the total 119 patients treated with Imiquimod the cowards healed completely; this was the case of 20% of the patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, versus 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of Imiquimod in five-time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superfizial cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all patients treated clinically were cured and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod in three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free time period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hypertrophic ac- lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 area of treatment on the hairless scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The two-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical decay after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">In paediatric patients, the approved indicationsof external coward warts, nude and superficial basal cell carcinoma do not normally arise and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies at the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks and respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute keratose was observed in three times weekly use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest dosage concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the half-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superdelicate basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased millimeter weight; a study of the dermal application, which was conducted for four months, did not produce similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice with malignant administration on three days a week induced no tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for humans to look very low due to the systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the effluent cream before and in greater number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2245">Nakin keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to the sun radiation during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied for flat actuators in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratsis or the virus responsible for infection with the infection warts.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have used Aldara cream or other similar preparations before you start treatment, please inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system. o Use Aldara cream only if the area to be treated after a previous medication or surgical treatment is cured.</seg>

<seg id="2252">Apply Aldara cream not in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or within the anus (after).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medications have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sexual intercourse during the infection with cowards in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) will perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimod occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of cowards, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin spot with the cowards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely covered.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath it (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist / pharmacist immediately if you feel uncomfortable during the use of Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin reacts too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells may cause you more susceptible to infections; it can cause a blue stain from you, or it can cause fattentiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if one of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice side effects not specified in this use-information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas that you applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually, these are lighter skin reactions occurring within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes at the application site (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scarring, skin irritation, bladder, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidose I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: increased liver, stiff joints, the movements more difficult, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitational devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its effectiveness (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over 5 years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement range of lung function), Tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to larvae or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will check all new information that may be disclosed every year, which may be known, and where necessary to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme manufactures patients who receive aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit for the allocation of Aldurazyme in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cells (Chinese hamster ovvary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidose I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient transfers this, every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting in which revitalisation facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the phase 3 clinical trial, almost all patients are IgG antibodies against larynidase, usually within 3 months starting from the start of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity reaction has to be cautious due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until symptoms have decreased, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the preceding reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time using chloroquine or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular image of larynidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exposed to the mother's milk over mother's milk, is recommended to not satisfy aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 and over, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions arose, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial oedema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with a predominantly severe running form and a treatment time of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a seroconversion within 3 months after the start of the treatment, with a heavier expiration of the patients during the age of 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature excretion from the study), 13 / 45 patients were unable to detect antibodies using radioimmunopulcitation (RIP) assay detectable antibodies, among them 3 patients in which it had never occurred to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG was detected in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, larynidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely about Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire range of disease, the majority of patients were from the mean phenotype and only one patient pointed to the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week (182 weeks) each week (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the viability shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>

<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the GAG mirror was observed in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestations between the patients, which were taken into account by using a combined final point, the clinically significant overall FEV (predictable percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk test, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">An open phase 2 study was conducted in which Aldurazyme's safety and pharmacokinetics were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe displacement form and 4 with the mean run-up form).</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and get injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, an anti-emetic drug (drugs against vomiting) and fluids should be given before or after cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood picture changes or where certain other side effects occur, treatment should be postponed, or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form is easier to furnish in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared in a study to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 micrograms) in the week prior to the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third cycle of action.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood picture should be created before each dose, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose overexamination must take place under consideration - saturation of the Nadir of the blood picture or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the predicted therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value of treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 doses of dose, a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- fort at the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above compared to patients aged 65 years, there is an increased side effect risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to not sufficient data for harmlessness and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not require dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper bilirubin- borderline and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of absence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times of the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to bone disease suppression and Pemetrexed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils count once again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- zyte count once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity, as observed in previous cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and nichthämatological toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinin clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) need to avoid simultaneous insteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylsacid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients envisaged for treatment with Pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients, in which these events occured, had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid buildup in transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion in front of the pemetrexed treatment should be surveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with Pemetrexed when this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Given the possibility of irreversible skull of the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment guard to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g a day) result in increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or ace- tylsalicylic acid are applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed are avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life time like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between orally anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetablolites severe labour defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy unless necessary and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm condensation.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed passes into the mother's milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby can not be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metabolic control, patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmacist, because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted.</seg>

<seg id="2522">In the use of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international standard ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta-carotene remain in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be recommended to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin consumption (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose Amiodaron, a limited number of volunteers who received orlistat at the same time were observed a slight decrease in the Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects identified after Orlistat's market launch is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size.</seg>

<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a quick regression of any systemic effects caused by orlistat properties can be traced.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is used in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine due to covalent bonds to the active serin-rest of the gastran and pankreatic lisuits.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have been derived from the fact that 60 mg of orlistat is taken three times a day, which blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the dietary fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg Orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaline, fat-induced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (chart 1) and as part of those study participants, which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline factor 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL Cholesterins was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat (3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">In waist circumference the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (output 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable for 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not yet metabolized oral orlistat in plasma could only sporadic and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients, which administered the minimal systemically resorated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl leucine group), were identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the addition of a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as the effects in this age group do not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance retains the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission announced its approval for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancers and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancers.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the thickness of the colon, patients should be closely monitored with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous offering of Palonosetron with medicines that extend QT interval or in patients whose Qt- intervall is extended or which tend to be prolonging such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs directed against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycloabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-state- Concentration of oral Metoclopramids, CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Based on a population based pharmacokinetic analysis, the simultaneous dosage of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodaron, Cimetidine, doxorubicin, doxorubicin, paroxetine, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences of using Palonosetron in human gestation do not occur, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events (a total of 633 patients) were observed in clinical trials (633 patients), which were at least likely associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the performance (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar incidents of adverse events, as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy for Aloxi- overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mcg of dolasetron (half-life 7,3 hours) were given, which was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous dosage follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface under the concentrations time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionally in the entire dose area of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg for individuals and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous dosage of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5 (± SD).</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokkinetic simulations, the total textured (AUC0- ∞) reached once daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the single release of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous injection of results, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver function disturbances the terminal Elimination inhibitor and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron are elevated, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures which are considered sufficient for the maximum humanist exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies revealed that Palonosetron can only block Ionian channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in approximately the 30-times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, epinierenmark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high dosages and since Aloxi is destined for a single application, the relevance of these results is very low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommending the approval of the allocation of medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C by alpheon 6 million IU / ml injections.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same veteran effective component that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic analysis, the liver tissue damage damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) are abnormal in the blood abnormality.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates this to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon specified data showing the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor on 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease rammed with more patients than in the case of a reference doctor; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study was not adequately validated in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection with crust formation) and small infected infirmary (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven to be detectable or possibly caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface to be treated is not more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleansed after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together at Hautwasser, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (iron-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, abrasions or stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for the allocation of altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and be considered an alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitizing or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully wipes out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary infected wounds the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after 2- to 3-day treatment no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retinulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on shredded skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral dosage of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole increased the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on shredded skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retinopathy is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral ingestation and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding continues / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / ended, between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman should be weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies on 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo have used, the most frequently reported side effect irritation was at the meeting place, which considered about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of retinulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding points of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the binding site ribosome protein L3 is involved and located in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindungsstelle and Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the Peptidyltransfer, partially block P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms appear questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences found in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin over S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus should be considered the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults 1% Retapamulin Salbe has been applied daily under occlusion to intact and on shielded skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic reception on humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 snub skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · H / ml) 660-times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under low involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymph oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-microkernel test for in-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 shielded skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study at rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development aid (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the market is being marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for placing on the market is obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacokvigilanzine, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and are described in the module 1.8.2 of the application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human use," the updated RMP will be submitted to the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area indicate that you should finish the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointments look for one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occur.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccine that is made out of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">This is why Ambirix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization and it is ensured that the inoculation plan can be put to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose for hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by helping the immune system (the body's natural defence), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the registered vaccine Twinrix grown since 1996 and the since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however TwinStar adults and TwinStar children are administered as part of a vaccine consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and TwinStar adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of TwinStar adults are also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in a six-month and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain on the injection point, redness, maturability (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued a permit for the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for basic compounding with Ambirix consists of two inoculation doses, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) vaccines are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully ensured whether immunocompetent individuals, who have addressed a hepatitis A vaccine, need a refresher vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3. for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the dose of the vaccine, the corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs are reached after priming, so that in these cases the offering of further vaccinations may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impact failure, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, with thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, Ambirix can be injected exceptionally subcutaneous as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with a combined measure- mumps-rabbit vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immunosuppressive defects must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccinations of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturality, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever is comparable to the incidence that was observed in earlier thiagulation and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and maturation on a calculation basis per Vaccesiosis Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the dose of Ambirix at 50.0.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccine, 66,4% of the subjects that had received Ambirix reported about pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects vaccinated with the 3 dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable to probands per sample (i.e., over the entire vaccine cycle at 39,6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose combination).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to those observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-doses-combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with ambient or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination-in combination with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the SeroConverter rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were 1 month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The SeroConverter rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two cans of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard vaccine with three cans.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 dose vaccine were significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunity responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-doses vaccine with ambient rix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs can be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was similar to those observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to and including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs are comparable 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine scheme compared to the in the 0-12 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the refresher of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measure- mumps-rabbit vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and servo conversions as for earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not completely protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both Lyme disease or hepatitis B virus (although you / your child feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest through itching rashes, respiratory or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly protect hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual scheduled administration of the second vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / her child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give your child a vaccination before termination of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected to persons suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's own defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently / has received / has received / has received immunoglobulins (antibodies) or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It may be, however, that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, amilitary or nursing women are not administered unless they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have been known since the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP opinion assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix has only been placed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammoneed can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain compensation as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammoneed is - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered by Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal-onde (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammoneed did not compare with any other treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without an active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammoneed can also result in loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, vomiting, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Ammoneed in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle was effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammoneed was approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifested form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first months of life), there is an indication for the use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy is in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulate form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthesis or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the emergence of esophagusulcera if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMOXPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenyl butyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">In patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with monstrous retention and edema, AMOXPS should be used only with care.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylafyyrat over the liver and kidneys is performed, AMOXPS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMERIPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowing of neural multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed accumulation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMOXPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMOXPS, at least 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMOXPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMOXPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anortic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in combination with lactic dose, severe hypokalemia, armoroztopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred in a 5 month old toddler with a single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms start with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, which is conjugated with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Poles are phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced for each gram of 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifesto-manifesting form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms of newborn was almost always infectious, and the disease itself led to death even when dealing with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylsulfate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborers at postpartal (however within the first months of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was with time with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifested form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic shape of the ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency), which were treated by hyperammonia encephalopathy and afterwards treated permanently with sodium phenylafyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidised to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate for sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous dosage of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat found.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycle disorders or hemoglobin opathies, Phenyl acetate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in the next morning after nocturnal fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis who were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylafyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma bar were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no conclusive effects (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg) with toxic and non-toxic doses.</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMERIPS Granules are taken either orally (infants and children, which can not swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">The normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthesis or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMERIPS Granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenyl butyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), there were lesions in the pyramid cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMOXPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anortic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in combination with lactic dose, severe hypokalemia, armoroztopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Poles are phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for excretion of surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylated glutamine in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram taken sodium phenyl butyrate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop 8,6 g sodium phenyl butyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication using a probe, AMOXPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenyl butyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen containing waste products, which accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you do lab tests, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMERIPS as sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMOXPS with other medicines please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or taken recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMERIPS as the medicine can pass into the mother's milk and harm your baby.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, decreased blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (an anomal measured value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox in sole administration or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often a stent (a short tube remaining in the arteries to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergone a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin in relation to all indicators, except for severe bleeding, where it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other shudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as with people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve Angiox injections throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST-Hebungsinfarkt (IA / NSTEMI)) during an emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion will be increased for the duration of the surgery to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous encore of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allsome bolus administration of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolus of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully blended before the application and the bolus dose is administered promptly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with severe kidney function restrictions (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with bivalent studies against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is under 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolus dose again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage included in phase III- PCI-study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment during an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after ending the intravenous dose of unfractionated Heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular forces.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other ingredient or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disorder of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible germ disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with other anticoagulans (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though in case of bivalrous studies, most bleedings can occur at arterial puncture points, in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) while the treatment is in principle everywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients taking warfarin and treated with bivaliudin, monitoring the INR-value (International Normalised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bivalirudin is again the level achieved prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anticoagulanants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombocytic aggregates), it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bicolirudin with thrombocyte units or anticoagulanants, the clinical and biological hemostaseparameters in each case are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate in relation to effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the retention or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractional Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalir group and the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age are more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to the Acuity and Timi standards for severe bleeding like in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-inhibitor and Bivalidin plus GPIIb / IIIa- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An Acuity severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point range, hematoma with diameter ≥ 5 cm / dl with well-known hemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known hemoglobin mirror, reconstructive surgery due to bleeding, using blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bloodlines occured at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" points of points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudin at 6000 patients who have undergone a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalir group and the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age are more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are classified according to system categories in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately canceled and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalir udin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and in the ion-binding region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalent in Thrombin, and hence its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin, on the other hand, splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalira was unable to induce thrombocytopenia / heparininducted thrombocytopenia / heparininduzieres Thrombose Syndrome (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following cases, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the Acuity study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was given according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST-Hebungsinfarkt (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before beginning of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or on the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the Acuity study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or elevated cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients undergone angiography within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with over 6,000 patients who undergone a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials involving a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of Angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalira as Peptid has a catabolism in its amino acid levels with subsequent recycling of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the split of the ARG3 pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the upper thigh or the upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or not to process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from the insulin analog, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of active life than a short-acting Humaninsulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been used in combination with long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body is unable to produce insulin, in two trials involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where insulin is not able to work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adult type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in insulin resistance compared to a reduction of 0.14%.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can impact blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH for the transport of Apidra in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the deltoid or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (her- regulator), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be conducted under strict physician supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the effect of the insulin used and can therefore change in changing the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase the blood sugar lowered activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, discopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, propoxyphen, salizylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or absent under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserves.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal studies on reproductive toxicity showed no difference between intra- linglulisin and human insulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin bolisin enters human breast milk, but in general insulin is neither absorbed into the mother's milk nor is it resorbated after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are listed in clinical studies known unsolicited drug prohibition, grouped by system organclasses and sorted according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration difficulties, dizziness, obesity, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Podystrophy is foamed to continuously change the injection cavity within the injection range, as a result of a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriate person or treated by a doctor due to intravenous dose of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucaine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin lulisin the effect of action takes place faster and the duration of active patients is shorter than with cou- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50, insulin lulisin in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucosesal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosesal effect, just like Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as the normal human insulin analog and achieves the complete glucosesal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal has reached a comparable postprandiale glycaemic control like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin lulisin was injected 2 minutes before the meal, achieved better postprandial control than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin-lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved like with human normal insulin, which is given 2 minutes before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin by 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) prior to the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
