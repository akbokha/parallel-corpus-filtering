package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . in spite of their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
for more information on using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select setting extensions ... Open the map card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras cr@@ ashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if any , delete .
the module An@@ sicht@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ sicht@@ filter . using the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory on different ways .
to use the DOM tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DOM tree ... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed website . as default the display starts with the root node of the document , example : file element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various icons and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in showing ne@@ sted folders with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow displaying the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder represents the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if it is far below in the folder hier@@ archy . therefore &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the confirmation representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color fixing and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle switched on view colour mode can represent either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can determine whether it is available at all , only if there is enough space for representation or if the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles should be used ( with which consequently display errors occur due to restrictions in the sign of the topic ) . in addition , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is propor@@ tion@@ ately to the size of the entry . in the Sitemap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always observed . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is quad@@ r@@ atic .
how to split the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . hereby , it is possible for the lab@@ eling and to avoid placing of space due to always favourable areas so that rect@@ angles are created that are as quad@@ r@@ atic as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can design@@ ate the minimal displayed area for an entry above the menu item View option on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the use of K@@ Cach@@ e@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the module picture gallery , a dialog opens where you can specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a la@@ the to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course each media and each card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be expanded using K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on the support of the end users . therefore you should report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you get &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all picture folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ Bar set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , which contains images , as root folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; see each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator as this :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you cannot excl@@ ude sub @-@ folders , unless it is in hidden folder . this allows you to insert extra @-@ containing &amp; digi@@ kam ; complete a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put this on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and My Key@@ wor@@ tel@@ i@@ ste to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so &amp; digi@@ kam ; possibly also handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help resource support menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder Settings and Ro@@ w workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course each media and each card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Im@@ aging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transmission over the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . see this link for a complete list of supported cameras .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support in order to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ lib . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things about &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I Module : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface Project ( Manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images everywhere : you can drop a picture in another part of the tree , over the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be put into keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the icon view . so the fil@@ tering works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind er is displayed as a symbol view . which fields are displayed in the dialog of the alarm settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view to your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ b properties or after the date the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Import images to scan . you can also add a screenshot to an album . select Album Import screens .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy multiple photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move it to the destination album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to click on the album with the right mouse button and select album properties in the context menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Kollek@@ tionen : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete new collections . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the elders , average , New Year &apos;s buttons : they set the date on that of the oldest , the latest picture or that of the album &apos;s average . to do so , first attempts to calculate the average of pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ als ; this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a night@@ mare preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be cl@@ utter@@ ed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the My Key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will give you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be shown in this album in the picture window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ v@@ ots in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time , you need to wait for the first time while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this in which you can re @-@ create all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be shown below the associated preview . which information is , you can change over settings digi@@ kam ; set up the albums page and customize the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor take a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important properties including all the keywords of a photo . the screenshot above in the section Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such an auxiliary window .
photos are all about it at &amp; digi@@ kam ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the features that came with &amp; digi@@ tiz@@ ing ; you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slideshow or editing the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by viewing either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... select the image editing section . editing image editing allows you to view and change your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing , other image editing programs may result in problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , ap@@ ert@@ ure , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way to click on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; deleted it will move into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image delete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Date &amp; quot ; organiz@@ es your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the Date tab at the bottom of the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
keywords are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . Tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search .
when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos marked with this key@@ word are displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word li@@ ste@@ quot ; to collapse so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then select New key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this is the key@@ word for this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select del@@ e@@ tion . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and put it down there . then a menu which gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the characteristics of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ words .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the image with the right mouse button and select it as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
around &amp; digi@@ kam ; s functionality with keywords to be used , you first have to add your photos with key@@ word . this can be done in two ways : as soon as you choose the photos you want to add with a key@@ word , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; alternatively , you can click on the preview of the pictures and select the key@@ word from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can choose a key@@ word for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event it was made , etc .
once you have finished a photo with key@@ word , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hi@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
f@@ og@@ ging the search box is a small lamp that will find green when the search results . if you click here the fil@@ tering will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found nothing , then the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search crit@@ erion . after you have been saved , it appears in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in the My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the search form appears again with the search information previously entered . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog for the extended search appears to change your previous search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select your search in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enb@@ ank . all rules are flag@@ ged by operators separately , en@@ um@@ er@@ ated . an option can be added to this list with search group All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... link . in addition , you can create searches of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CHT@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes every image by a long number with a special technique , hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by comparing these sig@@ natur@@ es . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natur@@ es , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar items : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . using a button , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from anywhere via the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : free @-@ hand color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the matching images . also here a sw@@ elling value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or out or hold it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pop up a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Get light@@ table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window open . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window , you can quickly open the light@@ table with L Extras light@@ table .
from the thumb@@ nail you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window and drop there . a small arrow indicates which copy can be seen in which window area . if you can preview photos from the tool@@ bar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the images , then they will be able to compare the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you navigate p@@ airing from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the left panel . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images .
of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions work directly from the light @-@ table like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swing function that you can recognize at the arrows crossed . in order to bend the visible area of the picture , you need to click on these and the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down both pictures in the same image area .
zoom controls under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this is done in both pictures when pre@@ viewed in the Mode preview .
what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . in doing so , we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , backing , optim@@ ising , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale inventory management takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , conf@@ ection@@ ates and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is data based on your definition of data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach allows you to access the metadata both in a database and in image files .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly be found across your location . if you have enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the metadata stored in &amp; digi@@ kam for metadata in the Settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do so &amp; digi@@ kam ; they have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should assign each photo to keywords , cap@@ tions and an assessment . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in the further work .
let &apos;s now use keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam will automatically insert the tree for you and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are handled by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata spl@@ its . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to descriptions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let most of you just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then start seeing some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming , associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you want to show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand about the subject you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect when it has the strength only to work with a cap@@ tion for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as label . you can even export it for a selection of images . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already driving with light speed .
the possibilities for utili@@ zing ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will be even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographical indications . &amp; digi@@ kam . you can also export the pictures to Gallery@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Maps viewers .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the set @-@ up page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization may be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the lab@@ el@@ age of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be equally completed .
editor ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here .
it is very important to popul@@ ate the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator may delete or modify them in the picture . for private persons this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the near future , such a module can be used for st@@ acking .
topics : plate error , disk failure , rap@@ ids , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tion
of course we &apos;re not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be treated more careful and you can no longer be trusted as a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which lasts longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk by using good discs and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the data back to check you . also , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected environment . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
Disk@@ makers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties com@@ prise a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks at the same time : Disk@@ og@@ er@@ u@@ die
shortly : dis@@ cos remain the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temperatures , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART cannot determine this error . some of SM@@ ART errors are termin@@ ating the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are particularly readers and publishers . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems .
while most electrical devices do not matter much , that is different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause gri@@ pping key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy slots and er@@ ects the rest . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against flash drive and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can use each cable to your computer , you should make sure that also all peripher@@ al devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for lap@@ tops , and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ stres@@ sing , these devices can automatically make battery energy available when a power out@@ age occurs . some models allow them to continue to store and run the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as a over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in current disturb@@ ances with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your calcul@@ ator is protected .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
compared to the hard drives at home , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the relatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . for that it is too slow .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . their free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage . thus , they are ast@@ er@@ isk .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transm@@ is@@ sions are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst part is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred . all these disturb@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you open a photo one day and this is destroyed for your surprise . it &apos;s quite disturb@@ ing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they generate internal frequencies within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk errors on a low level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux ; and Windows is available .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS is used and is also available for Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spot@@ ted .
open Source File Systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden stop during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 iris adjustments from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anybody else for data loss . so , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , you often save your data according to a plan and test this backup before making any more dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing disks .
suppose you make your f@@ uses daily on an external SATA drive . if , one day , a flash strikes you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft crashed : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore Des@@ aster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs , into your neigh@@ bor house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backing up the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ating : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . this creates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the complete backup and the last distinction .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . this creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . each further th@@ inning should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original ret@@ ains , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , usage of the internet .
so that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is approximately the time span in which you really are interested in because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
as the future is un@@ predict@@ able due to your nature , you need to look at all that is being told today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way of being for@@ wards as the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every@@ time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have plan@@ ed the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge to have placed on a dedicated plate or partition . with * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; $ ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollars ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ K ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modify the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ sy , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the dis@@ advantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and has a slow compression .
TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed and open blank format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and we hope that the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ ml ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . however , it can switch to problems when linking to the image file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include the work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as images are on the camera , you can use it as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ layer editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . these were sometimes trun@@ cated by the other programs .
use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them to Web@@ gal@@ erien , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the addition of a photos to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Alb@@ anian bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information that are internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the met@@ a metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS , etc . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or editing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of Alle . this loads all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection of &amp; k@@ de &apos;s standard selection methods . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and download the selected file . the chosen button will download as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new images are downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are filed . the list of existing albums is displayed , like normal folders . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you only want to delete some , you must select it first and then delete the delete selected .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully examine if the photos were successfully imported into a &amp; digi@@ - album before you delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera clo@@ ths completely , you should do this about the camera name , since this is much faster .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos of different recording series to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate in the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and reflecting the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are saved on the disk . the first two will affect the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information will be copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than standard format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . use the option Date &amp; Time to add . for further adap@@ tations you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the possibility to change the file names in lower case letters while downloading . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; for a photo uses , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform an automatic rotation during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , &amp; digi@@ arrived ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the button Extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam ; use this to automatically load sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to add this option . use the Advanced button and select the Dat@@ ums@@ Based sub @-@ panel at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know where the images should be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo can thus locate this aspect , it is good to store the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exc@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and map refer@@ r@@ als . the question is actually more , how the data in these fields come ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and finally via manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save this data in g@@ px format , as this is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and GPS . on the following page you can choose the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the features of ha@@ iry co @-@ ordin@@ ates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; to change to these settings , you need to set up settings in the Settings menu ; you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on Exp@@ anded Preview or Start image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fix if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standar@@ dis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected while downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should contain the professional designation of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author when it is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be registered here as this is the picture other &amp; quot ; offer@@ en@@ quot ; . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this means that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without going lost .
image cap@@ tions as embedded cli@@ mates ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images save : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other picture viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; display tried , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has none of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire from &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you open the lumin@@ ous , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In all image size sh@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better view results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colours are set here . in the image processing , this visible mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with the compression of PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . in doing so , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
you can comp@@ ress the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images with the option TIFF files . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it has no influence on image quality since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works without loss @-@ free .
when selecting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less settings , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops rapidly to a manipul@@ ator for manipul@@ ating your photos . using this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react with sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option makes the picture a bit soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance , which is photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top light , so the parts of your images are burned in , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the top lights as a continuous white . use the setting of continuous white in the settings . the setting colors dis@@ solve some unusual results since it shows the pointed lights in various ros@@ ettes . last@@ ly , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixel . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option to re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted for each image individually .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; editing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ grid data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as a C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w will provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like that . as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive homo@@ geni@@ tive Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction as you are carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile translat@@ es the colour information and gives instructions on how to be returned . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the colour information from a colour space to the other is to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in the image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; then examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your images are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or gam@@ ma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gam@@ ma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means that you have to do the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could manually correct you instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style look for the finish : F for an accurate style , L for landscape , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam can work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Short@@ cuts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the picture transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds fine . the other inter@@ sec@@ ting fields switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
on the right side there is a button Automatic Identi@@ fier , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and displayed in the picture mode . currently , here are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire bulk storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage eras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera . you must specify the path , m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to the display mode and turn on .
try out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu Cam@@ eras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images into the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections of del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without re@@ viewing . otherwise , you need to use the changes with the button to apply changes .
you can also include the display of the greeting screen from &amp; digi@@ kam ; when starting with it , this speeds up the start of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the setting B@@ oth start looking for new photos forced &amp; digi@@ arrived ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something was deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be used to adjust the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the entry View / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section image editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
editing editing functions change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file Save or Save the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo anymore once you have saved the image .
you should therefore create a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery menu or the button &quot; Rest@@ ore image processing &quot; in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last time .
almost every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . you can undo the last action by selecting Edit Re@@ ver@@ ted or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Recovery from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z for cat@@ chy and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift Z to restore .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressing the back or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : automatically select magni@@ fication factor
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not wish , you can change this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; change it from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for editing image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single images or entire sentences . all image preview pages can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures using the standard methods and select from the Album Album Export Output Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation sp@@ it , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again into the edge .
in the description view , you can type or insert labels with unlimited size . please note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down after 2000 characters and special characters will be changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the button App@@ ly or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then stored .
there is a button next to the Application button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the section rating shows an assessment scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ eness . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ est Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the valu@@ ation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the enco@@ ding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a box with the keywords listed in this &amp; digi@@ al session .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the entry field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have key@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate tick boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word in the IP@@ TC field .
if you select multiple images in the main view and you select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter .
the page bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views . if additional one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all generated keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop key words . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar tag . the key@@ word filter refers to No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
if you have a rule with and have created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can choose an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button . the options then look as follows :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner will have a predict@@ able devi@@ ation of the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic comes to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on color administration . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see more information below )
your only other image editions are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color administr@@ ations ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hu@@ h @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to cal@@ li@@ ze my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to cal@@ li@@ ze your monitor , since s@@ RGB is leaving your monitor . when you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you need to either cal@@ li@@ ot your monitor on s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting a further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu correc@@ ting automatic correction trying to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous intensity values above the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ osity factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity channel is as flat as possible . this means that almost every brightness range has the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroyed it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channels . it calcul@@ ates the dark and bright fron@@ ts and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete history of the hist@@ ogram .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ b@@ ulation of all values in between . this is only visible with wi@@ ped images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correc@@ ting are better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. Joch@@ ym . they launch it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side are both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right top , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shade details of your photos .
using the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature for the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and loads do exactly this . any setting of the white balance that you have set can save you into a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all fil@@ tering values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
here you can set the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ Bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this enco@@ ding also needs more disk space , time and is only available for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF , and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color mapping can be performed through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted on the chapter color administration .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always need the same mistake and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tools color effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure was triggered by the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity control the solar system . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually creates a negative image , so that it is not produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it simply , it em@@ bel@@ lish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ote ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : too much satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can carry out can be viewed in the preview . if it is the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous thickness / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is set for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated , you need for the application in detail only the area of the slider .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn operation is to post@@ p@@ one the controls , and to look at how the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : using this box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear representation is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the bottom for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values .
the three color pin@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is in the for@@ eg@@ round .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically placed depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and re@@ charged later . to do so , the Gim@@ p Lev@@ els format is used .
if you use this mode and three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for rot@@ - , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined output of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available :
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this box allows to specify the channel that changes from the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that were recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most sensu@@ al . in this case , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond to dar@@ ker output tones and that the associated image pixels are dar@@ ker .
to preview the original photos is a red marker . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shade , middle and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over @-@ exposure pixels . if in more than one channel is found over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ aire channel . shade and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ al channel bl@@ ender ; editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared with one &apos;s own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the picture will retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is the tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color space . if this is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color you need first .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any of the mixer settings for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined output of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original picture can be seen under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scene and air photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar light at day time . similar to the 003 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color ton@@ ing correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of p@@ itting a pressure and the re @-@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed subject ( 2 ) to see . the parameter Relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep your attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . under picture frame add the module from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . through the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button ff and decor@@ atively adds an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percentage . the range of values for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image , decorated with the frame , will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously used .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ch ; tool template you can put a template above a picture .
the menu image template in the image processing can be used to place templates above a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of sten@@ cil ; so please send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder appears . selecting a folder refres@@ hes the templates bar of templates automatically .
you can preview three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink this button . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then automatically adjusted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ ti@@ zation process has to merge with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink @-@ points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink @-@ points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally need more bear@@ able shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
for JPEG images , a camera is often applied to internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format on the other hand must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field ter already during the read@@ out of the image . if you disable them , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo using the sharp@@ ness of shar@@ pen@@ ing . this allows you to access the sharp@@ ness with the menu item .
you should be careful with this , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases sharp@@ ness of edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique is to re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus more information and compare all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than it is shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool for soft@@ ness with the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ly draw and experiment with some settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ har@@ p@@ ly mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus , you can define a minimum difference in this way for a edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty fla@@ ws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ well value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted degre@@ asing filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused &amp; quot ; in which it remo@@ ves the focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should yield 1 good results .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation may be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filters : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will further pol@@ lu@@ te the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness is eliminated . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try out all tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ ks produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ets using a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ clear color image that needs to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the kno@@ b l@@ utes the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area of the dark to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink cartridge provides a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the Reiter Gl@@ am and Advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ th@@ ness above the picture . weigh@@ ed against larger values mainly homo@@ geneous regions fl@@ atten and details . a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is subsequently necessary . please note that the detail conservation should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction dependen@@ cy .
alignment Ad@@ diction : alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes ev@@ enly across all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise , a high value is wav@@ y @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum satur@@ ation factor above all@@ y. p then defines relative smoothing . therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is required , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image .
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually here 1 or 2 is enough .
angular gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as best possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step range &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More to quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal . it dou@@ bles the duration . we therefore recommend it to leave it out .
the buttons save as and load do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then re@@ charged later .
correction of image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the for@@ eg@@ round that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts such as dust or ha@@ irs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny h@@ iss that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases only the sub@@ window Details and the advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radi@@ us controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel needs and can rot@@ ate the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller fla@@ ws .
sharp@@ ness : controls the Depth of Field . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks ahead to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubri@@ cation occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot remove the entire noise or noise peaks can occur . set it on a value close to the max@@ um if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ osity : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ em@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically rou@@ gh@@ ened more strongly . however , it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls adjustment of the phase atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is lifted up , the edges will appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high , can cause noise and phase j@@ itter to the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for reducing the noise you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied using the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten soft marks with the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ly and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most developed tools for reducing photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove the pal@@ ate &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ularity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting . the texture setting is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ e@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and loads do exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and re@@ charged later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise reduction .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ularity on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original picture can be seen below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos to remove with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras have JPEG compression over a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; in a photo with a dark image sub@@ contrac@@ tion method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to detect the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the corrected picture . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result inside the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average : it is measured an average of the neighbour pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all the defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ tering method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic ben@@ ds ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture can be seen below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ vi@@ ation , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not ev@@ enly illuminated the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses might also show this behavior .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the ap@@ ert@@ ure filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use center filters , an ap@@ ert@@ ure of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s filters and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a cent@@ er@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a shell that has been made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a cent@@ er@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light rein@@ forcement at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an ap@@ ert@@ ure setting of 1 , or by chance a light thickness of 2 , relax . increase the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vi@@ vi@@ ation , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image using these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of vig@@ net@@ ting correction to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ tic@@ ence in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; l@@ enti@@ l distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second grade deals with the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but is fla@@ wed at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient of fourth grade cor@@ re@@ cts the distant corners opposite to that of the second count . if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion .
in general : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion of the second degree . with negative values , t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distor@@ tion .
corner : this value checks the strength of distor@@ tion fourth count . this value has a stronger influence on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value re@@ stores image size and thus creates a correction of first gra@@ dients . negative values increase while positive image is smaller .
light : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog illustr@@ ates the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values for the next start .
the t@@ onn@@ or or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ en- / cushion distor@@ tion using the lines .
if you correct a cushion distor@@ tion the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ieren cutting from the image processing or using the zoom controllers of this dialog .
the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like photographs from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film by the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add movie gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter mix@@ es color channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film code applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the foref@@ athers .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter et@@ ching is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed filters such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of photo emul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ ting effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , Galerie @-@ artigen , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny sight specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gran@@ ting effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth controls the smoothing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the edit is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 Pixel image is 1 and smoo@@ th@@ ness 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ al filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sk@@ etch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you had chosen to sk@@ etch .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoothing ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adap@@ ting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ur shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a quick tool to give your pictures back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oli@@ thic landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving fil@@ ter@@ . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ tion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distor@@ ted here with another version of gla@@ ze blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the kno@@ b .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image along the star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a zo@@ omed camera and creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by rotating the pixels to a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
removal sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
motion bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography , camera .
soft@@ ness bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ending the image soft@@ ly into the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle g@@ low .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image by acci@@ dental displac@@ ement of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ries : find the pools in the picture and wi@@ pe it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the kno@@ b .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural your images a great look . it uses a protected algorithm used by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the size of the dro@@ ple@@ t does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops .
you can choose an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start to start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu transform@@ ieren fil@@ ming or transforming mir@@ r@@ oring .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Transform@@ ieren size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo auf@@ blas@@ en was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
aspect ratio : when this setting is checked , the size aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is required , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image .
the buttons save as and loads are used exactly to this . each installation for photo can be enlarged as text file and later re@@ charged .
blowing photo is very fast what makes it , but it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ atable by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the magni@@ fied image ( 3 ) . pre@@ viewing ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows this very easy . to cut a photo , you need to use the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle . you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be s@@ lic@@ ed by drag@@ ging it to the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply pressing the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cut button for image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save File from the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the Preview pane you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the Tool Up aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in high format , the greater value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format is assigned to the width .
the tool To cut aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the area to cut to the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After cutting aspect ratio saves his settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the trim tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image values are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the setup assistance settings allow help to hide , so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party gel , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden mean : the golden center is a division that is divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful .
the golden spac@@ ing is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden spac@@ ing in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s ga@@ ze along the line of spir@@ als and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye can be at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral . its verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be found a static object more dynam@@ ically .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect called dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the Horizontal Flip and Ver@@ tical options can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image around any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right side .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after fil@@ ming a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to use the function transform@@ ieren cutting from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the feature Automati@@ cally cut . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture gets a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing .
the sc@@ rub@@ bing tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ieren po@@ inters .
sc@@ roll your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can sc@@ roll horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the shot tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture is wi@@ ped out a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two re@@ duc@@ ers generate twice as much bias and therefore you should avoid this .
after the she@@ ath , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ iles . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats to those . this is done by file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam will change . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept more information in the section Con@@ figuration .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; support both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression techniques to digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very useful instructions in English . you can convert raw @-@ format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; convert . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; support the loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; all support cameras can be seen below on the Dave Coff@@ in web page . the table below shows a short list of raw shapes supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; die &amp; k@@ de ; Settings to play movies to start playback .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module .
many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , sof@@ tw@@ ave , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ets , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type which displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image below . below , you see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture applicable ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the compar@@ ative mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal sharing . the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to preview the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the picture from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all adjusting entries from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or out or hold it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pop up a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ etten files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for choosing . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box On C@@ urs@@ or is activated under the color button , the color is inserted from the color chart at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end sign if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;

&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . graph@@ s are used in science , in particular in computer science . up to now there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; include , are ob@@ sol@@ ete according to the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; does ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that an alter@@ ation of the graph is in &amp; can ; the graph is re@@ charged and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a unique ; -@@ component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window will only open the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more ru@@ dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this survey using the context menu or automatically select this position .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just been modified in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later as it is done . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei outside a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph@@ s that are already running in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
at the start of the program , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also set how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph on one side should be adjusted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the relevant parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without header and with another font
the Renew@@ able Load page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or request the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify if a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time you are asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which normally appears on a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; opens new possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge tri@@ mming as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for uns@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for uns@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man pure gold he@@ uris@@ tic , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .

the ge@@ ographic location of the K@@ IP@@ I module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width grade are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ px @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization cor@@ relation . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog will then appear . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file .
if the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT and therefore the camera height must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place , you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the Inter@@ poli@@ shing and Differ@@ ence options in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog box is the coordinates of one call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and enlarge Si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the menu has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the selected tab allows you to select all the albums that you want to export to HTML . you don &apos;t need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right hand side allow you to quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the preview preview and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
the tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each picture will create a gallery in which each image will also get an own page . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show .
the album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the standard color depth . of course , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during generation . the web browser will automatically end up to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .

after the start , an image is displayed as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ Wear . attention : participants of this list speak English .
the metadata editor K@@ IP@@ I module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list for the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then open the Import function . this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check out exc@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV format .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . for burning the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you have to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can set up the module about extras MPEG slide show .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transfer is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high level very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave it black . the name and path of the generated file can be specified under the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file named the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all your preferences , you can start the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly or in total relax a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow once you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ der or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages above the button settings to the bottom .
the print wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for a direct print@@ out .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original price of him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ p ! .
first , select the raw file to convert and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in mode for a single image . using the Preview button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or later use it otherwise , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG format as memory format , the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ ride existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo . the target image , including background , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you started the module , the images window will be shown with the images you have selected . you can add more images via the button Add images . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and drop it down to add you to the list of images to be sent .
with the button to remove images , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject .
do not mind too many images at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after choosing comments in an attached file , the comments on the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format below the File format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats like e.g. TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original @-@ ex@@ if@@ data are added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically end up . with the closing button , you can close this window .
after starting the module advanced slide show a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the option Open@@ GL transi@@ tions in the presentation will enable very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the file name option displays that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in random order . therefore , it is not the order of images used in the album .
the time interval between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between images choos@@ es another effect .
during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it off .
with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool to set an image as background image for the desktop .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub menu , as the background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails .
if you hit persons with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person you will only see the images on which both persons are visible . by this selection method you can limit the number of images shown on a few thousand pictures on a few single images .
if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store your own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined for yourself .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of persons and a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t own suitable images for your keywords ) .
you must , however , specify which image to display for each individual person . to do this , you need to select the image viewer window ( in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . here , you can customize the image for the appropriate person . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and by choosing which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you access the search in the main window , a dialog will show you a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for fixing the image properties . you can view this dialog on the picture once more .
if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the descriptions and descriptions of the pictures will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also type a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like reading hand@@ books , but want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the snap@@ shot , the scre@@ enshots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu item k@@ photo@@ album ; start the demo .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a co@@ hesi@@ ve HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the Tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip can be seen here : . as the name suggests , it shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the Tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar shows another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the Tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be shown in the preview preview ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create from the File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and purpose . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings .
next , select if a photo@@ album ; -@@ Export file will be created which is to be seen on the overview page . you can find more information about the export files in .
last@@ ly , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information displayed on the viewer without description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best option is to select a root folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , started . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . to enable the import function , see , properly you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the root folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the currently available settings have all three related to base folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have spent a lot of time reading the picture information , persons on the pictures , recording place , etc . , then you need to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not even make this work one more time .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image characteristics are ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and can pass this file independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can export via the File Export ... menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
at option Manual to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ sch option close to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option on this page is maximum size limit . if you want to send images to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu File ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard for import consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ el the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the file to be imported and which categories these are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database .
it must be easy to browse images and view : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups and m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is portra@@ yed .
in this manual , you will see the various steps of ( 1 ) capture the information about your images , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced subjects and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , you talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the index@@ .x@@ ml file in the upper@@ most folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can back up with a program of your choice , such as standard backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the C@@ VS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder in which your images are stored and use it in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings options are explained .
on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call through a button press to the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
we describe how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left window of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list with the current category and in the right one list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ Bar and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can be called via the modules module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most of the modules have a help page that you can call about the modules itself .
since the modules of multiple applications are used together among each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always check the demo database using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their images into albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
thereby simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview currently .
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category that you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category people , for example , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you had selected persons to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , look at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain a lot of information , since you don &apos;t have any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is the possibility to provide any image with notes . this includes information about the persons displayed on the picture , where the image is taken . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images simultaneously .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting individuals , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are pic@@ tured , you can , by that the used names are moved up , find the persons faster and assign .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sort for sort by date on the list .
if you have selected comments for each picture individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with comments . in this case simply click the front and back buttons , which are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the note dialogue context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this requires you to sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the single elements of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the lad@@ der that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
when you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers you the ability to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also f@@ ade a frame completely . if you want to see this window later , use the Options button ... and here a / hide window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or any images if you have no filter . you can configure the thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simply .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the removal button or select to delete the selection in the Edit menu . now , the window will display you can see in the picture .
you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images can also be used without you saved on your hard disk . of course , you must have saved the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are available , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function takes you to copy files from folders and copy it back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance , how to avoid confusion of your pictures , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all images on it .
in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end the ones you want to do for others and click Lat@@ est View lock in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also view all the images that your little sister may see , alert and select the menu item Every@@ thing except the current view .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images , so that all the images you have locked can be hidden . if you want to get the pictures back , click on Sper@@ r .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set this password , simply select the password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can be able to read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to protect those who have with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to with@@ hold the view of private pictures .
the reason you are all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason has a photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in it . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag them with the mouse and move somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether general information is to be displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the pop @-@ up menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to this view . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus respectively minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can move into the image and zoom out . with the minus key , you can easily pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . the plus button zo@@ oms in the center of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zoom .
with the dot @-@ key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key key , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ation from the context menu .
when you look at images it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and view them as good or poor@@ ly , while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to tag pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , they are available in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , then simply copy them all at once with notes . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to display categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the attribute after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to paint a photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your gem@@ old later .
in order to switch to the painting mode from the context menu , select on the image from the context menu . to end the painting press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you should have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to paste the object and click either the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu item in the P@@ aste menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following pop@@ up menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar using Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to adopt these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then , you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly again or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the installation dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can preview the property view .
click thumb@@ nail preview and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to ren@@ dern one part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a level of view as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their level of view is smaller or equal to the point of view chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window layout or if you need a different layout , you can adjust it as you like . you can also save multiple window orders and simply switch between different direc@@ tives .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the whole height .
if you want to assign multiple views to one another , drag the author in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map of the map at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the temp@@ ter to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the tool@@ bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the pin . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views in the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
you can save the current window view with View window layout ... store it . a dialog appears where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render them ren@@ der@@ . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 up @-@ to @-@ date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon rendering the tool@@ bar icon or select the View scene menu item .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ quality images .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to recognize the mode of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section section and enter the image excer@@ pt for rendering into the input fields .
in combination with quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for rendering purposes . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions illumination . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with just one ray ever pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or scale effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling implies the neighboring pixels . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is repeatedly divided and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colors .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , then both pixel will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the low value to 4 , a grid of 5 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calculated . it takes very long to let a scene calculate with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams do not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; scene file , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; Not yet the full command sum of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings appear while im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; POV @-@ ray . to import objects to the scene , simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copy &amp; paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here you will find the path to your retention and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter information ) in the paths to the Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to insert the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the viewing area in the camera view and in the windows type license .
you can adjust the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values give a more precise wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
when you tick high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended proj@@ ections , all the overhead proj@@ ections are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to render .
when you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a bottom is rendered under the object . the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you tick edge detection , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering of scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value . more precise information on the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window regulations , explains how to create and store window orders .
the drop down standard window arrangement : displays all existing window layout . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders lists all existing window regulations . a new arrangement allows you to add add @-@ ons and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the chosen window layout . new views can be added with the Add button and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with map card you get a card @-@ card view together with the previous view and floating , the view does not anch@@ ored in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you have a scene without objects .
the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera shows the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation about &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the button App@@ ly or the En@@ ter button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a cube ( insert End@@ liche Body Qu@@ ader ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the button App@@ ly or the En@@ ter . in the object tree the new name will be shown immediately .
the wire model view also displays the plane , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited end@@ able plane . when you render the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the item for the floor by clicking on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens where you can choose how the object should be inserted . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , by clicking on the button preview see how the pig@@ ment now looks .
of course , the pig@@ ment preview shows only a matte black material , because you still have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the squ@@ ad and the ball in the preview , click the App@@ ly button first and then call the Preview button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ dern your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the colors that you have expected . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called unic@@ ol@@ oured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select any color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should simply run as you should have understood the basic mode of operation of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press En@@ ter or button App@@ ly ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor as you have moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now produces a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step you will find a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material . as already on the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select First Sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on Ball pig@@ ment , then select colors and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection have already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you can create and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender Method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en scene , the ren@@ derer is shooting hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scene ) by each pixel in the scene . the render comp@@ utes the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as m@@ ist affect . thus the scene pixels are processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space .
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu item can only be selected if you have not saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command . this menu item can only be selected if you have used Re@@ ver@@ ted Re@@ ver@@ ted .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog box in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and standard behaviour .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove the tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump map is a possibility to apply rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ r@@ action on the surface separately , without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel @-@ basis by applying an image file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be shown in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialog Ein@@ richten - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards of cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows .
if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set below . default is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , loads and ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when closing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; to set up that only some of the file types will display , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default .
specify whether the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened more .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the entry field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .

&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ room ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes its part to at least problems and possible improvements .
this shows a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and desires . if you use it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and desires . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to leave your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto , we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto .
the best start to participate in the show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ room ; .
&amp; show@@ foto - tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto . to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ room menu in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicator section you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you are supposed to indicate . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure .
the main window from &amp; show@@ foto has a side bar at the right edge providing you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not make any more than images to scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make images and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save images instantly in a given folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of support for your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and click OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can only start a Vor@@ sch@@ aus@@ can and then select scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the Preview button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview in the window fits .
when the image was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings , then the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the same name dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option before saving must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images save . dialog to open each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , then you need to save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to choose Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the option Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix that each time a picture is stored . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Help starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs short@@ cut . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cut can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Global keyboard short@@ cut by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Short@@ cuts .
you may set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts , making your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P capabilities of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; Amar@@ ok also has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; -@@ dialog &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should help each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change signals that a new piece is pi@@ ped . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title Plus contains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add a custom item , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name like e.g. mein@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ an@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with extensive amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should ap@@ point your script pack@@ ets correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to load modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is ready , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and add the link to the Wiki scripts Page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nonetheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the play@@ list instead of working through endless menus . maybe you just search a very specific title from thousands of in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Col@@ lec@@ ting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many gen@@ eric USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so you can choose how to listen to your music . this and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the root folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter any problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable to compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the player window displays the player window in addition to the play@@ list . if the option is disabled , only the play@@ list window will be displayed .
use V@@ ood@@ bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
Tuning : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
remove sound files from music files : this function is only available when compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to start when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save play@@ list when saving , stores the current play@@ list automatically when adding &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the play@@ list of the play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces when changing the piece , causes the play@@ list window to roll down / roll to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
when switching to context @-@ browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is pi@@ ped .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gray represented section . you can select scripts for the following range : play@@ list window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the drop @-@ down dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated , for for@@ eg@@ round and background color .
re@@ play when starting to res@@ ume that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback will automatically continue with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last end .
setting the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display enables you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be shown in the O@@ SD .
using custom colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment to display the O@@ SD .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate further settings in this card card .
the Map Collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to his name . this section also contains check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub @-@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub @-@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all play@@ lists found in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ list browser .
the part collections database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , further configuration is necessary in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup .
the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ set section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : the machine is typ@@ ed on which the My@@ S@@ ql database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the card last@@ .@@ fm prepar@@ es support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece as required .
here enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website .
send off played pieces and thus refres@@ h the profile : this setting enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile .
retri@@ eve similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . note : you do not need last@@ .@@ fm profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ enshots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs therefore ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , will make trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the tag@@ lib library for days . you can locate the file by following in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and let the collection go again .
mostly this is because Tag@@ lib is cr@@ ashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to cr@@ ashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate autom@@ . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 to the met@@ a info , but do not label it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;

if you get this error : berth : icon look@@ up error : berth : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can use ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ yn@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are some ways . most of the installation problems are ligh@@ test by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .

after starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank play@@ list appears . how do music pieces enter there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub@@ window was converted to the statistic window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column has to be displayed in the play@@ list . click somewhere in the new review column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them drop there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is stored . click on it .
probably l@@ acks the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also check for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the e@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual issue loud world media types supports G@@ Stream@@ er / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder is supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input paste
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously display audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. sb@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
it does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ co@@ ded first . you can simply listen to a white noise . G@@ Stream@@ er is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can print directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine .
either use the G@@ Stream@@ er Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of the Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable the sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been highly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ d@@ les react the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er , you need to register all components . run g@@ st register to register all of the G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stream@@ er .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run g@@ st register , once as a system administrator and once again as your normal user . then delete the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ config and run g@@ st @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; run playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped going to bed .
how to find out the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on a different computer ?
if there is a working SS@@ H environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece from : s@@ sh -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent , variable @-@ changing window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click on the queu@@ e . by pressing the input button after a search in the play@@ list , the first search result is played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my Personal folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after the launch of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for one piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the play@@ list window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select rating or press F2 . you can edit the rating also in the dialog metadata .
the developers do not want you to specify when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term posted plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find anno@@ ying . disable the option icon when playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars to set up ... and take the desired changes there .

Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please update the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stream@@ er . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
probably use a distribution which is installing the development files separated from the actual program . even though G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the required development files are missing . the same is also valid for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
setting setup Amar@@ ok ... Audio output will give you the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

enter the output dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio edition with Arts won &apos;t be taken care of . you may naturally like to take this issue yourself into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : )

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a play@@ list that is superior to all the others . the play@@ list window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including the creation of a collection and a play@@ list .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already ex@@ pi@@ red game time to the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the running text display are also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is activated or dis@@ ables the play@@ list window , while the button E@@ Q is used to set E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control and the piece @-@ position slider . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . playback buttons lets you start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in e@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all the audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the e@@ quali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the e@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed play@@ list of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the full@@ ness of features not deter them , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side of the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the play@@ list , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . these three sub@@ windows are later added to the details .
if you have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , you might notice that the sub@@ window will fail . the information presented there now has been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the performers and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to search the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you will find more information on the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view covers images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the pictures may have any name , but images with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display cover images that are either embedded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recomm@@ ended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the compositions there are the favourite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set what information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you &apos;ll see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the play@@ list .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text for writing scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script runs , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpre@@ ters - only group@@ ed the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or gen@@ res are ignored .
group@@ ing interpre@@ ter / album - Once the pieces are sorted by interpre@@ ting and there will be another division according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing interpre@@ ter / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by interpre@@ ting and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ ter - your pieces are sorted first by genre and among them by interpre@@ ting .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ ter / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album under the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing according to your needs .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ record your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for using this filter can be found in the section to the play@@ list in this manual .
below the search filter there is a selection box , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose between the last 24 hours up to one year . in addition , you can also select your complete collection so that the filter is virtually shut off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This creates the current play@@ list and inser@@ ts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function fits the selected pieces into the queu@@ e . thus , you will be played next .
save as play@@ list ... - Save the selected pieces as play@@ list . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Ad@@ ds the pieces into the queu@@ e to transfer to the media player . see the Media Player Browser section for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpre@@ ter / burn to CD - The selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be shown .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm it , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
marking as a summary - marking the selected album as a compilation , and it appears under various interpre@@ ters .
undo selection mark@@ ings - chan@@ ts an album marked as a syn@@ op@@ sis back into a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ter .
the play@@ list browser is quite simple to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that has never been played yet .
even created Intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click on Intelligent play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new smart play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the media player browser again .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the play@@ list and let them drop on the list performer . if you are done , click App@@ ly . by doing so , the pieces on your iPod will be up@@ loaded . if the transmission is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive integration for your iPod .
beneath the tool@@ bar there is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z enter and press En@@ ter , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag the music from there into the play@@ list and drop .
if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simple drop @-@ down . in this case , the holding of the Shift key may be helpful : by doing so , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the play@@ list en@@ lists all pieces you play to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter separated search terms by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter e.g. one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other key@@ word . example : one OR two OR three . in this example all items are found , which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you would like to search for entries that contain spaces , then circum@@ navigate the key@@ word with the go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific key@@ word , set a minus sign in front of the key@@ word : -@@ some search for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syn@@ taxes as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the commentary bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key pressed , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned .
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the play@@ list . it contains buttons for some functionality of the play@@ list . on the left hand side you will find the Add button to add to the play@@ list . to the right , you will find play@@ list stores , play@@ list empty and pr@@ one M@@ ischen .
next , follow the buttons Re@@ ver@@ end and Rest@@ ore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the play@@ list .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , larger Analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window via the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example play@@ list controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on menu and set up tool@@ bars ... select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on play@@ list . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be changed easily by clicking the mouse twice into the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on menu in the play@@ list . by this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window Visu@@ alization plug@@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry , a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu , you can select what should be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queu@@ e administration received your great suit in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the play@@ list . after you set a piece in the queu@@ e , the play@@ list will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play the pieces : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the item in the play@@ list and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the play@@ list . the order of the pieces can then be changed in queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already present ( details to set up these follow later ) .
fills your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and adds additional random pieces during playback .
adds bits based on Last@@ .@@ fm Certific@@ ates ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires some pieces in your play@@ list . you do not need Last@@ .@@ fm for this dynamic play@@ list .
click twice on the play@@ list you want , drag them into the play@@ list window , or right @-@ click and select Load . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new play@@ list . so you should save the old play@@ list under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of random@@ ly mix and play@@ list mix immediately fill in your play@@ list and you can add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection , so your play@@ list will be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , then enable the latest possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as starting point . the dynamic mode can be disabled again via the same menu entry .
the New button popul@@ ates the current play@@ list and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the settings accordingly .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic play@@ list allows you to click Edit . then , the dialog to edit the play@@ list settings opens .
enter any name for the play@@ list here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will be continuously growing , the setting for coming tracks will be passed and they will not be heard twice in this play@@ list . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed using the setup played pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the play@@ list , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the play@@ list after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the play@@ list will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists that are crossed .
some scripts make your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click App@@ ly .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts can be installed by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . then , select the script to ext@@ ingu@@ ish , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Wr@@ ite of Scrip@@ ts section .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program bur@@ ns audio or data CD @-@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ of@@ s ; : bur@@ ns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that include &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality in burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( such as MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ h@@ ack Dec@@ oder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , FF@@ m@@ peg can de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ coder Modul .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and Super Video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . for example , it may be useful to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can result in the un@@ pleas@@ urable effect that the music pieces are played differently according to each other .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the root folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and change . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ stored project what should happen with it , as if you would have called for each project file closing .
includes all open projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any non stored project you will be asked what should happen with it , as if you had called a file closing .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the root folder of the CD .
opens the &quot; Br@@ ennen &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button fir@@ ing , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described via the What is this ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b files to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you are not used for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help to allow you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function remo@@ ves no files from the medium , it only blin@@ ds the previously imported files .
it also allows you to create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
this allows even without a project file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also just create a picture of a DVD which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . the conversion / reduction of a DVD using the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + R ( W ) so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write mode over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
bur@@ ns a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so ) .
bur@@ ns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously read DVD video can be converted . this dialog appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , enco@@ ding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; When an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ lock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view enables selecting and pulling files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after choosing one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the short@@ code allocation to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows for the correct permission to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be performed . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function scope , so it &apos;s more your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the attached programs give you the default .
in this chapter we assume you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD , and other functions for generating new projects .
boo@@ l ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref : ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void er@@ ase@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( kur@@ l ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( kur@@ l ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can obtain a project through the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Th@@ rough this reference it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String flags ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String n@@ wn@@ ame ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inser@@ ts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; read@@ able for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders enco@@ ding these WAV files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( These enco@@ der packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored into WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less fla@@ c .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the enco@@ der packages need to be installed that are needed .
which enco@@ ding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as I have said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to b@@ yp@@ ass a protected audio CD ; just avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , afterwards the daily use to read a &amp; CD ; explained to the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the next step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
start the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an enco@@ der was configured in the code settings tab , the enco@@ ding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . it should be noted that before the enco@@ der was configured in the code settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already loaded file is selected for enco@@ ding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main execution dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like En@@ coder , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter disc@@ usses sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the correct enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compres@@ sive rates and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files .
under the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality in lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing instruments exists .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems .
a short list with parameters to audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate around 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good gen@@ ug for music by young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ o@@ anlagen . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ San@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ ding program to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the calcul@@ ator . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( with the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained from a stroll through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active a check box to choose ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( f@@ ake ) address as the system furnished in the system . in this type of configuration , so it appears , the e @-@ mail address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done .
to save the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and hence the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab card to setup the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ der . more information about co@@ di@@ ers is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read @-@ true on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own scre@@ ams on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something with the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for any read &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der used to use ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; download data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD ; change when the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the read@@ out program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device labels for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
here &apos;s not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined here . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot .
only with incomplete information requested , so that you will be informed if information about generating key@@ word ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily using Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the drop @-@ down boxes and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , consider this twice as well . to fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and enco@@ ding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; after reading the last piece throw out : check this to the &amp; CD ; to disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must the path / folder be specified in which the WAV files are saved . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as mentioned before , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous enco@@ ding WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change them again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and set up .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , see the scre@@ enshots below a bit different from those for a CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter the data instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example to find . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD now has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then search in the section questions and answers after help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully retri@@ eved by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window blin@@ ded , and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the link to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for each comment ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with upper@@ case letter or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment range . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to that which is &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the code settings tab ; take a look into the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help to get more information .
simply select an entry which is obviously wrong with the style of the release CD ; in this example , this is not important because we don &apos;t give the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
when you click on the button selection to read the read@@ out process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out .
click on the tab assign@@ ments to switch on the order window . it is located in the left top half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece of reading .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this is done to read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in performance @-@ less machines , the result is un@@ clear . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queu@@ e of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be blin@@ ded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; will now chat within the &amp; k@@ de ; C@@ VS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs when running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations of settings . it &apos;s best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different file cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first time of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program start there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; however , whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it . at least only after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this proposal .
strange , if you succeeded in obtaining the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; ist der MI@@ DI@@ - und Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of texts also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ mid ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound Project Drivers , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards in order to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the respective procedure .
session support . when you quit &amp; k@@ de ; quit while playing a song , k@@ mid re@@ starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window to drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry Play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played succ@@ essi@@ vely . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the speed display and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original pace , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item , breaks down playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in a piece of music in two ways . some pieces use tex@@ tual events , others use lyrics events and others both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be presented and even better : the event type is automatically retri@@ eved , which one song uses , so that you do not have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text in the Settings menu . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries text events or rec@@ it@@ als from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these are played after the row . in this section you will find how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original collection .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection is not stored . remember , if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add to Add a song . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic Add to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File opening or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally Add to Collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the pieces opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song further , select the button Next song , next song from the menu item or press the arrow button to the right .
to jump vice versa a song , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be ext@@ ingu@@ ished and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translat@@ es into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and will always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have one sound card , you do not need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite is that each occurrence has different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END define key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; END define key@@ map &quot; One more key@@ map ... END define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END OP@@ TIONS ... END
you see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds that this instrument uses to attach to the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot .
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun@@ fire ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Tro@@ mmel @-@ Patch , the patch is meant to represent another perc@@ ussi@@ onist ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ acas , etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as is its presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the key@@ maps provided .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to change the first and the second channel , simply do it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel which is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined further in the file ! if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM is pret@@ ending that a keyboard that gets a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards attempt to play two sounds up to one oct@@ ave higher . in order to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI Map , simply open the Di@@ alogue MIDI settings . you can find it in the Settings menu , point MIDI settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the point Channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices at very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without A@@ WE support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all the files individually .
accept , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
previously activate the setting of Automati@@ cally Add to Collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , just switch into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the window and drag the file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off the setting Automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you only want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to Collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , that anim@@ ates me to continue to program &amp; k@@ mid .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ WE @-@ card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ IS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course hear no music .

the application window is made of so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is to be found in it .
it is possible to store the preferred links under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , then you should use the section for permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / , can also be selected from the View menu and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the same with play@@ list from the menu , selecting either the Edit Mode , or selecting another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same play@@ list .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; some functions can only be switched on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files .

it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / authentic@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation when starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be anno@@ ying at the end of the animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; In@@ digo &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ;
there is a tab for configuration of MP@@ layer in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; here , the path from the MP@@ layer and the cache size of the data stream can be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ MP@@ layer . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the config dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c file , like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; it can even add the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file associated with K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can be started in a con@@ soles application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on is supposed to return all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can play from TV cards , either using MP@@ layer or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be installed , the device and TV channels need to be configured , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) Settings in the K@@ MP@@ layer , the dialog in the settings on - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port is to be used . ports should be detected by which one is selected . the enco@@ ding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contained a dv@@ b in it .
because the V@@ DR support of K@@ MP@@ layer can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ linux extension for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , K@@ MP@@ layer is used for the sources different names . at the time of creating this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ Scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
is there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as root after installing the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can show on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why every time my CPU has to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for compile &amp; tile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably refers to the package &amp; tex@@ act ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; tile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the tile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the tile ; website .
if you have questions about or compile &amp; tile ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed at the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this easy , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to find out more about &amp; does ; and to know its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start there directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate .

while here is only a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be able to properly domin@@ ate , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
as well as other mark@@ up languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the more general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text @-@ lists can be specified as well as a font with the text . the introduction shall be closed again with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be re @-@ closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick ascent assistant of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; tile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some options for the creation of the document .
document classes : this will include the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ klin &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
enco@@ ding : hereby the character enco@@ ding of the system is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be weigh@@ ed ( for the correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users do not have to worry about . it is just a brief description of the functions and more detailed information will be given in the section .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; K@@ ile ; it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
with the automatic completion of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; tile ; automatically creates an empty line ( for the input of the text ) and the associated line to the closure of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the code settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the lowest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI , file &#91; ger@@ Ã ¤ te@@ unab@@ hÃ ¤ n@@ gige File ( engl . d e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; was created , navig@@ ating &amp; K@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the standard output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the mouse button , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are associated with the editor and as soon as an element has been cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , it becomes the exact opposite of it . as soon as it was cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the corresponding location in the DVI ; viewer is j@@ umped .
master document : this function is used for working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source text ) .
file surveillance : in this mode the DVI ; file on Ã ³ n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â twe@@ eter Ã ¼ ber@@ wach@@ t@@ â soli@@ dly and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when looking at the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large en drop @-@ down boxes should be noticed . the selection fields were developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapter , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are :
the Ad@@ ditional button for further information is available for articles such as keywords , joint notes or references . the available options include :
name : this command creates a description for a section , an image or another element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; manually written by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¹ e is used for determining the font name . it enables the font sizes to be set for the main text , the joint notes , etc . , the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; K@@ ile , there are two options available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ document class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font e fixed . if the font does not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen oder des Kn@@ op@@ fs Schnell@@ bau .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically exp@@ ires the storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , logging should be sought after the errors . when using quick construction , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be noted .
environment ( close environment ) is a text that will be treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font property e 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ ling@@ and \ \ end { environment } will then add the Ã ¸ n@@ derung der Schrift@@ grÃ ¶ zÃ ¶ gli@@ cht within the environment { Ries@@ ig@@ â ¢ auxiliary ( g@@ able ling@@ o ) .
the changes are only made within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } up to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many options to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , curve pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . , can be added either by the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the ital@@ ics and is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language is presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; C@@ ile ; .
once in the wiz@@ ard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments should be performed for the better read@@ ability of the document . this should include a quot@@ ation , a few passages in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ trl E can be converted back to the editor ( with internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window needs to be closed .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun .
DVI . this files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows converting the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text was created , the conversion can begin in the tool@@ bar using the K@@ nÃ ¶ pfe .
the preview search allows a direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex files . to do this , you just need to set Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools Build are selected .
the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in one line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on for@@ wards search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI converter is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; tile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; tile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if using quick @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI @-@ viewer does not open , an error may be present . if an error is present , this is summar@@ ized in the logging file or in the news window .
the logging file suff@@ ices the source code in the source code . in the editor , the pop@@ up predi@@ ctions La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for j@@ umps between the errors . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log and &amp; tile ; j@@ umps to the faul@@ ty line .
once the button is cli@@ cked on the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options include :
when selecting Emp@@ ty Document , a document can be written either from scratch or used by the wiz@@ ard for quick creation of a new document . for more information , see the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by adding an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can set up in settings K@@ ile ... Settings Common .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by typ@@ ing in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Documents class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { item } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be completed :
when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created in a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and can be performed using the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; works ; as internal editor . &amp; does ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and writing from many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; are therefore made directly from &amp; tile ; out .
to find more about &amp; does ; and to know its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex command refer@@ enz that can be called via La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , and their syntax .
a double click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way , clicking \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p will only be \ \ par .
when drag@@ ging the text with a third mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with twi@@ sted Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editing pane .
&amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and empha@@ size them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many wiz@@ ards can add additional jump marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu entries are br@@ anded or the corresponding button keys allow the jump to the next or last spr@@ int mark . this spr@@ int brand is also highlighted , so that it is automatically read when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; although &amp; gt ; already excellent possibilities are added to &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text always has many environments and groups and therefore support &amp; tile ; special commands for their selection . under editing select the following commands for text selection are included :
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines which contain a blank line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , it does not mean a text with consistent lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning closes thereby tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only bent cause in &amp; tile ; is that the intervals are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains a lat@@ ex command line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; sort ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; C@@ ile ; with its own commands , the following commands are included to delete the text :
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; tile ; is contained in the Description to Edit Ex@@ cep@@ tions paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; that &apos;s why &amp; K@@ ile ; for more commands under editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command you jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , will be ski@@ pped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environmental commands a quick overview of the surrounding environment can be lost quickly . this command ent@@ ails the last modified environment , so that the altered environment structure is not distor@@ ted .
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the wel@@ ded bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the folding cl@@ asp .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the wel@@ ded clamp of a &amp; tex ; group # , will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many scre@@ wed groups par@@ enth@@ eses can be lost quickly . this command conclu@@ des the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not distor@@ ted .
in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple reference marks are used as a valid guide . for the Pur@@ pose implementation is used in &amp; tile ; the sign &quot; for two simple suits is used . &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and holds two closing suits for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double inc@@ ub@@ ation mark can set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
there can also be any specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ano@@ or french ) and can be used with German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
pressing Shift ; En@@ ter for &amp; C@@ ile ; a smart line break . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; C@@ ile ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , t &amp; tile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close @-@ ending line break .
even better - &amp; tile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings C@@ ile ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby arrange all Et @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; sucht &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab in the above line .
although &amp; gt ; already a good source code completion offers , it has been added to &amp; K@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still extended . all these modes can be arranged for different modes of operation under settings K@@ ile ... can be stopped .
when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command &amp; tile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
if the click button is pressed , the last letter of the input will be removed and , unfortunately , the list of entries will be added . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are easily removed when selecting a command , so that a jump to these positions can be reached by means of editing br@@ ushing marks , which can easily be added to these positions .
under Settings C@@ ile ; setup ... C@@ ile ; exec@@ utable settings can be made to these lists . you can select different listing lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as w@@ afer b@@ ushes of the general language used .
command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the full list call will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when calling the full @-@ time mode of the menu or the button switch Alt + Shift key , the command will automatically be plug@@ ged into the surrounding area and it will appear \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est manner and termin@@ ated by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile ; realize that it is a list environment , it is even a first \ \ item command .
under Settings C@@ ile ; setup ... C@@ ile ; exec@@ utable settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the guar@@ dian list of full @-@ time mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; K@@ ile ; support user @-@ defined lists of ab@@ brevi@@ ations that are immediately replaced with lower strings . lists can be set under settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be set up . as an example of a query list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ ab is used , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is initiated over the menu Edit or the key C@@ trl + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L is replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large cranes are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many w@@ agers are written in one document more than once . this offers &amp; C@@ ile ; the completion for all written w@@ agers .
this mode can set up K@@ ile in the menu ... K@@ ile can be scre@@ wed down . here too , the threshold for displaying the completion may be determined .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / des Pers@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen home @-@ folder . mode stands for ab@@ brevi@@ ation , dictionary ( serial book ) or tex .
the dialog graphics capture the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics about the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and respected .
PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools , and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to view the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all tools are group@@ ed in the menus to compile comp@@ iling , create converting and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further transformation can be used the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and viewed by alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command Quick @-@ construction , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project will take over the project New Project .... By asking the following information for the project :
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; tile ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in further versions of &amp; tile .
first , it must be said that the development environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ act ; are shipped with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; tile ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ act ; provided , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ act ; the small application of tex@@ ti@@ k , containing a database with all documents and a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the most important advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or stro@@ kes . from &amp; tile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the void of space paste opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ph@@ er and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be found on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ ile ; utility environment ; is also a part of the Fink project , making &amp; tile ; also available on &amp; Mac ; installed with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who are striving for the continued existence of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project aiming and sacrific@@ ing for many hours for the development of tools , which we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU / License . current information on the contribut@@ ors is available in the Help Ã ¹ ber &amp; K@@ ile ; .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sig@@ natur@@ es for emails . the command line interface lets you create acci@@ dental sig@@ natur@@ es or day sig@@ natur@@ es from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natur@@ es for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random sig@@ natur@@ es , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . by many sig@@ natur@@ es with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day sig@@ natur@@ es the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , you use different sig@@ natur@@ es , as with the acci@@ dental sig@@ natur@@ es you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add your signature in the lower section . signature @-@ example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org When you save your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S File Save or click Save the Disk icon .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows mein@@ pro@@ c and how superior it is . do we raise it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the up@@ set work folder , then release the current job folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then let them simply select the current folder . if not , then select the current folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is incorrect . please check the reported errors and try again .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we start editing plug @-@ ins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several persons work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties -@@ dialog .
the name and email are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to uniqu@@ ely identify .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze Command . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears gre@@ ase after which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for further information on notes .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that happen when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone was working on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that inser@@ ts a file into C@@ VS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Con@@ figuration Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the addres@@ see selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ s@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see where such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comm@@ ent@@ aries by the following things :
input notes is simple . either the note entry from the editor context menu can be selected or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment area followed by note text .
notes may be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the inserted nick@@ name of the team member is , role played a role in the project from the following options : team Manager Area Manager Sub@@ project Leader , the appropriate area or sub@@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends across several pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can thus be changed .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal large / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : like above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and finish tag automatically : if switched on , the corresponding closing day is changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ ic types for detection of various types of files . using button Standard , the default values can be restored .
standard character enco@@ ding : the coding of newly created files or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is wi@@ ped out from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; periodi@@ cally creates backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as storing the file .
the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a card reader ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is accessed by changing M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section is used to control the display of war@@ nings by checking out no more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source @-@ text view in shared mode .
here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details .
in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the section Stru@@ cture @-@ tree settings , the visibility of knot@@ s in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree during editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the area for fixing ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded during editing to more extensive text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following should be specified :
address : the path to the plugin , if it is not at a default location as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is transferred to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied the loading . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then testing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . select allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the troubles@@ hooting has been developed completely ane@@ w . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of super@@ vised variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
a view where all stops are listed with time numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . normally appears at the bottom Do@@ ck .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is fired by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that it does not have to pay attention in the normal case .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
instru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bit request has been started , the script starts with the request .
instru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to super@@ vised variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution runs on . if it happens before a requirement is given , the execution starts once a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include clu@@ des .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , and if possible in functions and include it is in@@ consistent .
instru@@ ct the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for market and scrip@@ ting languages , as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes off &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag files contain two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic key@@ ing of picture kno@@ bs ( above the editor window ) , which could insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than one user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the proprietary catalogue , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any danger of a writing error .
tag @-@ folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files carry the name of the description language and version , so exists . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML , declar@@ ing whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type over itself nothing else .
the type of the tag is a script function . when used it is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . in addition , it contains other tags to describe how this attribute should be shown and etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cut and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; what@@ s@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg termination , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Start window and select Tag@@ X@@ M@@ L. check . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is not currently available . currently , the check is only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following one example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file is supposed to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as fairly simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D Edit DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for one sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set up actions with settings ... click New action to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the user button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ a the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document to the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ P .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script can be found in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% pi@@ d : is replaced by PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text unique is attached to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the external script is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods mentioned above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the default input . in the input field input can be determined which is to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : normal output , written to standard output ; error messages , written to standard error output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written to the standard output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in any case , there are not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings Files .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable Di@@ alogue &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics else programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size other .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green becomes mostly as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled , that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Application button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or you should set them to a better overview through some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar set dialog via Settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by tasting of all symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable addition of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository to check if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to find an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = Your description for these document@@ ations e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index page func@@ 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html Tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html Tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html Tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , ...
notice the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files are replaced .
the section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which serves to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script to display the documentation for the mysq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global usage . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the disc@@ ern@@ ing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at various locations there is an email menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email sending tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archives , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make an airport contribution , we recommend that the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you may select one . in the New resource dialog you have to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the upload will be started .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signi@@ fication . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a notification appears to indicate the cre@@ ators of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files in XML format might be necessary . it gives the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target Cat@@ name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Do@@ ct@@ ype Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ command : the string to appear in the Do@@ ct@@ ype day , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine setting of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool gli@@ des , actions and patterns in a global tree , which then each can be available in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which allows the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the tree view , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click on the right mouse button to retri@@ eve a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all the bin@@ ders , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or run C@@ VS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area lead to another context menu related to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple tag , such as &amp; lt ; insert into their document , then click the icon that represents the tag . if they want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the component views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and to go through . in the representation of cardboard gri@@ ds are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation of tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of incorpor@@ ation into a global , local and project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . by clicking the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as to launch , edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it man@@ eu@@ vers can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned with the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for web @-@ technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached , edited and viewed project specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , which can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are shown .
this tab shows all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts executed , give all error messages ( so there is ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive to &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; auto @-@ conf has a number of options to be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a close idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolute greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far along the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be kept that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why to develop what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to enlarge as they need for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts , and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became an advanced editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta exec@@ uting ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as M@@ anti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML , so that they are displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces into &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very useful if your &amp; PHP ; script reports error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
switching and switching of the problem re@@ por@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ por@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of a mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set up by means of settings dialog box . tool@@ bars are stored by tool bar tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or someone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refresh@@ ed without rene@@ wing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder does not exist , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu default in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by means of tool bar is denied if this day contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax of syntax for the current file . the list of available Her@@ vor@@ heb@@ ungs@@ schem@@ ata depends on the same ; -@@ version .
select the type of line identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switch between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes need time or cause unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the appropriate sub@@ window to be activated .
activ@@ ates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect every application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
jud@@ ging the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of works , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add them and change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom , e.g. after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ beispiel@@ e ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started ane@@ w , not hooks .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to the di@@ lu@@ gs .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hook , or by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard will contain three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or using the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to above , also files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the sub@@ window profiles upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by decre@@ asing their own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can set event actions and add , change or delete event actions . events will be executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project will appear and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu that can be accessed by the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only more one profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removal .
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on disk save -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address function .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simple de@@ bit of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be accessed , opened or deleted from the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has to do most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best made via the tool@@ bar menu . use and add @-@ on are disc@@ ar@@ ded . adding tool@@ bars will be handled at the bottom of the Add Tools tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , a New tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bar can be removed , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , where it can be specified which actions on this or other tool@@ bars are to be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bar settings in the menu ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use templates basically like a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations one prepar@@ es for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template before use .
bin@@ ary templates are usually included in documents by links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally more special documents are made in corresponding sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is to be inserted in the documents again and again . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole web sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
design a document structure as desired ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Template As a local template store ....
as soon as this has happened , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the storage area under project templates .
select text in your document and click File Now save Sel@@ ection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : copy the file only into a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right of the file tree or in the project files tree view to create a name for the template and secure . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pret@@ end header lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , add files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window template is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes are spoiled .
this is enabled by default and fits for anything except the root folders in the template folder . if a root folder would be configured , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the p@@ ale would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows a prec@@ urs@@ or text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second shares the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ side and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and turn back when needed to source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL . to edit &amp; PHP , the source text editor is still needed . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible in the source editor as well as in the V@@ PL ; the cur@@ sor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , this mode is already active , the key pressure switches the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , where the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation interval between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small chip for fast computers and a large chip for slow .
the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this is used to mi@@ tig@@ ate the edi@@ c enco@@ ding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of the content , such as keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the display of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cur@@ sor is possible like in a text processing , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and by pressing a button or remove button .
the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . note that the inser@@ tion of tags before already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed by any other ambient anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars such as the table assistant or the list wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for testing style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style template can be trac@@ ed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path name . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top@@ loaded style template fil@@ en@@ ame with relative path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ text called QNAP or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNA@@ P@@ cloud , which contains the string template .
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; expanded to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1

adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; and the value &amp; lt ; VAL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation on the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
if the conversion takes 20 times , if --@@ repeat is two @-@ fold , then the conversion is executed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for it has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml
activ@@ ates the X@@ Incl@@ ude processing of the input document , if the support for it has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is switched on as default
on systems with installed re@@ ad@@ line library , you can browse with the arrow keys on / off by the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes may be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on RI@@ SC OS systems other environment variables are allowed .
path : a path to change the folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : XML data or XML document that is edited by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LEN@@ AM@@ E@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ;
running time commands : { bye _ BAR _ exit _ BAR _ quit } , step , Step@@ Up , step@@ down , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ option , options
there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the recovery at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in mer@@ ging .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare the text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it into one of the compar@@ ative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps dis@@ solve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps with the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of a complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are shown visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease typ@@ ing by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file completely . for example :
Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o Ziel@@ folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 -@@ o Ziel@@ folders
opening dialogue enables manual typ@@ ing of file names , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or the selection of a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialogue keeps track of your selection and displays it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is executed .
by selecting a folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in both other folders .
when merged , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not essential to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening , you do not need to select files , you can close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these features are , it would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load and compare them . now , you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop down of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag@@ ging and placing text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) each info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red for it . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is to be seen in the next section ( merge ) well .
when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is represented on broken lines .
the result window ( under the compar@@ ative windows ) has also an info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; modification &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text already , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump of position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . )
this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps select another source . this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . carefully go with this function .
note : when selecting the source options ignore the options or enable Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly with the image @-@ bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , up , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ v as you are used by other programs .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . by inser@@ ting button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the section summary and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Fig / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the selection to clip@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ P@@ aste ) . if it is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and manually copying . be careful with this option , as you might acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use slide back + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ ary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; Set K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays writings with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen font does not support this display nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ anned . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically creates an un@@ just color .
if enabled , when pressing the tab@@ ulator key , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted .
when you press En@@ ter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual into the clip@@ board then .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when compar@@ isons of files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines in the source files can be found . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . normally ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the carriage returns are made visible , however , as a white sign is treated . during the merge , this option has to be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; -@@ &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; .@@ &apos; , &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in Automati@@ cally jump mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will be passed .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the features Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original attached . if there is already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must quit and rest@@ art , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
there is a brief reference about the code settings for the enco@@ ding , which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the enco@@ ding is individually custom@@ iz@@ able for each file , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the enco@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress down@@ s of changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded over@@ see column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal or a second over@@ see column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just stop the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window next to each other or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your needs . you can use this function e.g. for cutting dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or correc@@ ting the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will be passed to this external command first ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command @-@ command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l will suff@@ ice completely .
use this command for new@@ lines to convert the input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a gran@@ ular expression of the text found in the first string . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case .
C@@ VS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ . so you can change the list as required . \ \ \ 1 \ \ $ \ \ 1 \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line balance . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use &apos; to separate the compositions from one another . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Ho@@ wever , some details are different at per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for display and mer@@ ging . further operations only change the data that the line interval al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hi@@ des differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate the mer@@ ging and shows the simul@@ ated changes without really carrying it out ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window on current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files will be listed , which have been compared until then .
if the scanning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or by double clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this sort .
as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option folders are synchron@@ ized . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : mer@@ ging together and saving the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge ( un@@ sure ) is enabled , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during the merge one file is processed after the other . you status column displays finished when mer@@ ging has been successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected arises . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
if the file compar@@ ative method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ diff@@ 3 will show further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ds ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode C will be used as target , in the two @-@ folder mer@@ ging B will be selected as target and when syn@@ cing , A and / or B will be used as target .
if you have selected a destination folder , check if all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to ski@@ p by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select folder merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . in order to only merge the current item , select action of the current item or press F@@ 6 .
if the conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears which points to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog box will appear with the options through @-@ run , simul@@ ate and cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are done with a file , select again / continue folder merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you decide the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you have the option to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before proce@@ eding to merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; Set K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are shown in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * .
files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by C@@ VS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by C@@ VS . the major advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a leading score marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in the default setting .
when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links display . this is de@@ activated in the default .
if the option is disabled , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ) will not check for possible re@@ ur@@ sions . ( note that a link to a folder containing a link on itself would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is switched off in the default setting .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting .
the files are considered as identical if they are equal . this may be useful , for example , when copying the change date is lost . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting .
if there are differences , instead of merge the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is switched off in the default setting .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original If an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension , this will also affect the normal merge of individual files , not just mer@@ ging entire folders . this option is switched on in default .
normally , the folder merge view remains visible during the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to the main window in the pop @-@ up menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
you can also directly merge a file directly without having to start the folder mer@@ ging . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder mer@@ ging . as soon as you save the result , the status is set to be completed and the file will not be merged once again when you start the folder mer@@ ging .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
a path can be relatively und@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link displays a file or folder . then always a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently being seen as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then extract &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and preview the K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ar Comp@@ are ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool Collection .
I &apos;ve been using G@@ PL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or going to go this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t have the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resource for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this tab is coinci@@ dence and the case .
the editor notice for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort required was so far too big . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used by another editor .
after removing text , lt ; No sr@@ c was swe@@ pt ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of last changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you shouldn &apos;t have any problems while comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cutting ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . inser@@ ting ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift P@@ aste ) inser@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
only differences show : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
only entries are displayed that show differences . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in the default setting .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed accordingly when clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop space as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and other .
with the middle mouse button , window inside &amp; p@@ ager can be moved ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries of p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application and the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and end . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces .
when this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager display the numbers of virtual desktop space . if it is ti@@ cked together with name , the names are provided with double numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the background .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty desktop space is displayed to enable them to choose .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its standard icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , as well known from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very good for the representation on the surface on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as icons or with its contents . besides , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set @-@ up switching of switches ... dialog settings can be displayed .
at the moment , this can not be changed in the dialog box . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you must apply the key win@@ dow@@ Clean mode and assign it to this value . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual imp@@ air@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on performance @-@ less machines .
when you start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . the picture shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in default , it enlar@@ ges &amp; k@@ icks ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mo@@ vable magni@@ fier . alternatively you can use &amp; k@@ not ; for this cause a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting of the mouse cur@@ sor . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it using the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you push the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to add it later in other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
start or stop updating the display . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time against 0 .
select the Upgrade rate ( Very Low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
this mode displays a selection window . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ lar@@ gement and Redu@@ ction &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as a magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fier , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually handic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor res@@ ides in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and that each mouse @-@ click p@@ ains pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor res@@ ides in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and that each mouse @-@ click p@@ ains pain . however , it may em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ yp@@ ass the pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the intelligent shifting is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button exec@@ utes . in this way , you can run the pulling with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this delay time must be packed after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
if intelligent shifting is enabled , the shooting range is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before it res@@ ets the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse occurs in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click with mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving forward leads to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . this moves are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , but it can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there .
sets all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the application , the settings will be reset after the last pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent shifting should be switched off first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the intelligent shifting .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first , you should make aware of which places a mouse click will remain without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can therefore park your mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear quickly if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scratch the dirt and the so@@ iling easily with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent shifting in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you yourself execute a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; still execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , acci@@ dental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas for the tool@@ bars and menus and the header lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to mark it in this way to copy it into the clip@@ board and to insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice on this :
do not use intelligent shifting if you are just starting and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will take every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click to play . so you know exactly when when intelligent shifting starts the shooting time . later , you can use the intelligent shifting also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X windows must be installed . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor res@@ ides . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and that the pressing of the m@@ ason causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is left . in this way , the drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping with the mouse can also be carried out .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth , mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose phrases that should be spoken again from a list with the course of conversation .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screenshot ) , enter the command later used for the voice output of text . for more details , please refer to the description of the setup di@@ alog@@ s .
on the second page , select the standard text book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages without typ@@ ing them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screenshot ) you will find the dictionary for word coding . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to specify the frequency of the single words . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are recorded in the wording .
the main window from &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a running memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
if you have correctly adjusted , you can enter the pro@@ positions in the input field that you want to hear . each Spo@@ ken set is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets of sentences that should be spoken again .
with the Settings Con@@ figuration menu , set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the Page Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ ase and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card card voice output , type the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the character enco@@ ding , with the text passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text remains unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x .
to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service , first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text pass@@ age@@ book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of In stock the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down of the editing window for text pass@@ age@@ book , you can choose whether the text pass@@ age@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text pass@@ age@@ book , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ age@@ book is not saved . choose Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved .
the Page Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ ac@@ ing contains a list of dictionary entries . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word crossing .
with buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the text box .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add just written words to the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vo@@ cabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the upper part the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ age@@ book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting from the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text tab@@ s is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text tab@@ s is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
when this menu item is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu item is crossed , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu item is checked , a sliding bar for text pass@@ age@@ coaches with entries is displayed . the bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output right or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up Settings ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the map voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers for more details . )
the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use festival free and without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ TTS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS for free and to dis@@ semin@@ ate restrictions .
to show an example of the command line to set up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eze folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option must be switched on as default input .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator is set only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust .
to setup use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
around &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully used , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on the detail of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can leave text by the calcul@@ ator . a list of already spoken phrases is stored which the user can re@@ produce again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not contain a voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer you have to install a voice syn@@ thesizer .

this also works if &amp; is unique ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; it noti@@ fies you about events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . you can set up various types of messages . for example , you can set up that you receive a message in which your nick@@ name occurs . mit &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu item noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which belongs to the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; belongs , is a good example . it remo@@ ves the tags br and b from the messages sent by the mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ tle ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is edited before it is sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to choose false spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent specific short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ di@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the retained orders will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and plain text . these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you &amp; eg ; a long text read on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; greet someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages are also news .
the rest are simple text entries . each job you encounter from the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ ite is an example of a applications that uses text entries . text entries are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text jobs as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be more types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the sub@@ set parts can be specified either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre @-@ defined enco@@ der inser@@ ts such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included in the scope of package ; include some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you , for example , have set a female voice on the card card speaker , you can read text of K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text remains unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of installed normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alog@@ s will be shown below .
to set character enco@@ der filters you have to type a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern . if this pattern is found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as arbit@@ rar@@ ily , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column sub@@ set by . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click on the button to display a list of languages .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID run programs can be sent with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copy .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter by applying . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ator ( whit@@ esp@@ ace ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alog@@ s Add or Edit as help to assemble these expressions .
XML ; conver@@ ters translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied on well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the speaker selection filter you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the card card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . you can , for example , specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; translat@@ es a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker attributes that the program exec@@ utes the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speaker defined on the card card . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the subscri@@ ber you want . if the text meets the fil@@ tering conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , which matches the required requirements . click on the button to the right to view the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or er@@ ase all settings .
the microphone output filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mers can give their applications TTS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the k@@ de ; accessibility webpage ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output lists via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of text to read and select a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands ,
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Windows . first run kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then t@@ sm@@ t@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML conversion filter , but when using the module for festival pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SAB@@ LE works at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also ensure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause mistakes in the syn@@ thesizer , so that entire sentences are ski@@ pped or just dealt with che@@ wing . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character enco@@ ding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string reset filter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand and extend for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the XML conversion filter but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disc@@ ar@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code for k@@ de@@ mic or downloaded the tar@@ ball issued every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if speech disc@@ ur@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; which uses the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into single sets . the user can leave a sentence or reject , repeat or cancel the output .
if an application displays text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will be used automatically the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose a spokes@@ person , you will see in .
if you click on the card icon speaker to add , and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the card card spokes@@ person set will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details of the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is contained in PAT@@ H you only have to enter the festival .
select the character enco@@ ding for text to be passed to festival . for voices that are known to the festival , this setting will be done automatically . generally , western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider tra@@ ders you set the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display this gray , the voice you have selected does not allow you to choose these settings .
some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster ( with greater memory usage ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window can be displayed at the beginning of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon t@@ sm@@ 0 icon in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr still does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application , which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just edited sentence . the spokes@@ person ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokes@@ man .
with buttons in this row , you can proceed or withdraw from the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be copied and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr becomes a symbol in the section of the system . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio map audio . see also .
only text entries are listed and managed . output of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages will not be displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts has been compiled ; either without support for the corresponding audio module compiled or &amp; kt@@ ops ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ km ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ mc@@ . % approximately twice the normal microphone speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ on system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt select standard .
on this card , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language records :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader has been read , the retained orders will be res@@ um@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next highest priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of news and plain text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have a long text read on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room .
will be interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introdu@@ ctory sound and introdu@@ ctory message are active , the introdu@@ ctory sound will be played before the introdu@@ ctory message .
the settings on this card pass are only valid for normal text entries . for messages , al@@ erts and the output of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages to be read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card @-@ card notification appears .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads no noti@@ fications .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event will read the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs . you have the following options :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the required subscri@@ ber . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the map card . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option , the action is set for carrying under default ( all other events ) .
the All Noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) . for this , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows :
save the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voice , speech speed , volume , voice and pitch . furthermore , trademarks used for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of such as ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the default voice , the festival used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ .0@@ ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limits filter ( SD@@ B @-@ filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds supp@@ ress text into single sets . this allows you to start directly with the preview , as only the first set must be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the whole text order .
here you see the set @-@ level detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ level detection filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add additional set @-@ limits filter , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up your speakers by selecting and selecting text for reading . check on the card selection process , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; select . to do so , check out some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s choice changes . of course , you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can then stop or cancel text @-@ orders on the map card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this function .
for these reasons , the normal movement detection filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set @-@ limits control filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ulate ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( tab@@ ulation symbols are automatically removed from the text before the fil@@ tering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders .
if you have removed the standard code del@@ im@@ itation filter from Ver@@ sehen , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the card booking card . the card card is displayed if
use of the default speaker ( the top@@ most one on the card card spokes@@ man ) . in other words , there will be no spokes@@ persons .
use of the most appropriate speaker that displays all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the subscri@@ ber &apos;s settings , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the required subscri@@ ber here . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything .
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other features . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a primary property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in another language as the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker area , which is most likely to be ext@@ ingu@@ ished , click on the default speaker on the drop @-@ down button and then use speakers closest to the text .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , the entry 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get trac@@ e@@ ability .
G@@ Stream@@ er is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ops ; it was completed . probably you need to register G@@ Stream@@ er . if the problem is not solved it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stream@@ er .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , fre@@ eze &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; a message appears : the device to open PC@@ M appears .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not display this voice .
add $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ int / voices the new voice . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the URL , where you found the voice to the developer .
on the card card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card card for speaking device . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you &apos;ve received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free TTS syn@@ thesi@@ zers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . you can find help in the instructions provided with Festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you must type MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone for the voices . select a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) enco@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for Festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic file like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Syn@@ thesizer takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create these di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be used from German texts .
in this procedure , additional wr@@ apper code will be added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the Festival / lib / . instructions can be found at

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ er.@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ er.@@ conf package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ ed.@@ Provi@@ de for the user a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ er.@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers have already been installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ loads ; the device at all shows and the setting of the net values possible .
in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are being installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by custom@@ izing the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module will be loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which is best suited to distribution and rel@@ ap@@ se . by marking the setup non @-@ return questions , the definition can be taken permanently . in the next start of the network settings , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray displayed , which means the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system administration mode , by clicking on the button system management mode , you get to the right lower end of the module . it is required to input the password .
in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the Reiter network interface :
the settings displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... setting up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking on the button Advanced Settings shows the dialog with further options .
when selecting Automati@@ cally , TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information for each system start , hence no further settings are required . in the drop @-@ down list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
the manual can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field net@@ mask the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog will be shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as needed . activ@@ ating an activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off as needed . activ@@ ating an enabled network device can be turned off by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
sets the computer &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain reference by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer only needs IP addresses . if the host requests htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will solve this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to name resolution part of the rider name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .D@@ .- entries can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons Ad@@ ding or Excel in priority .
by clicking the button Ad@@ ding ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution you can add a DNS server . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list .
select an entry from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution and then click the Edit button . the Edit menu will appear .
the list of names known is called host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address refer@@ r@@ als for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for boot when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list contains known hosts some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and support some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP is still to be replaced in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known machine and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the familiar computer has several alias names , press button Add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named machine from the list and select Edit ... The dialog to edit computers is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately available in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command needs to be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ ed.@@ is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of bin@@ ary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is enough ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ er.@@ The following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second all of them are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ ed.@@ alter@@ able configuration files .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to pass through the near future . this is why this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person who shares a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a range reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to a lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part you will find the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ ed.@@ where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is other content to be found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar who also offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre@@ stres@@ sing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pres@@ spell , searches for the right index on your record . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the re@@ index should be recre@@ ated .
everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes , to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the belt can now be searched by opening the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting in &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not require format@@ ting of the tape before being format@@ ted . flo@@ ppy @-@ tape drives usually do not require format@@ ting of the tape , on the other hand , DAT drives do not .
after entering the belt called and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the belt . all data on the tape is lost thereby ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files shown in the profile are backed up .
select files in local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Safe ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item .
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the job folder for checking .
if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ produce the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives which belong to the tape record entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore menu .
once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the folder for recovery .
when you confirm the settings for recovery , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re@@ produce the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can re@@ produce the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder where backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected work folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in it are backed up on the same fil@@ esystem , as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be used separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently from the others .
exec@@ uting an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then have changed .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings above the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; dat ; before the band is mounted the command will load load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the discharge from the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all the tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when fixing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be administered directly using the GNU ; -@@ tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a system logs ; the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , enables &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your machine in the background makes . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence trying to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screenshot , provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol lines of a log file can easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup , try and k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not appear , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually not available in the / var / log directory , for the normal user usually no permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by selecting the selected filter criteria . the list of the log lines is now automatically updated so that only protocol lines will match the selected filter . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter contains the entry All . then a log line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can also select another entry at this point . the character string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the name of a process , then show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are indicated with a stri@@ k@@ less color as the protocol lines of the stage critic . the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned on @-@ up dialogue .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . for example , this may be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the pop @-@ up menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org you will find more current information about the sources from &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and also named as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of program starts when running the system in the Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go down here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ ary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux kernel looks first on / etc after an In@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sys@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly into / etc . this folder is named r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things as Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when running high .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . in the beginning you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab manually and change the 3 . if you have a bit confused , then come to repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and doing the following :
but how do you start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script will stop with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that only runs htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of availability system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts from Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) .
note : entries are moved if you move them to a new level . to merely copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the destination area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ um@@ bers of the surrounding entries before attempting again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to enable the different work@@ spaces ( Verfüg@@ bare System@@ dienste , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and cur@@ sor keys to make a choice above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are extracted from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine is rest@@ art@@ ed . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE , or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the Distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply complete without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you have configured space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card file password management appears when Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears if for at least one built @-@ in file system space constra@@ int ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space limitation .
the cart@@ on card groups inform@@ s about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , can be found in the field of Prim@@ ur . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the big field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu User or group , or click the appropriate Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO System Selec@@ tor , add , remove and change the boot password , change time to boot of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
