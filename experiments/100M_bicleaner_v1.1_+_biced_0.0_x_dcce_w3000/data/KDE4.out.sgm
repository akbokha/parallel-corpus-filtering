<seg id="1">The Module Website can be translated in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Website. select the output and target language of the translation from the list down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated into the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translatable texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror;. in spite of their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select setting extensions... Open the map card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings modules from the box kde; addons. please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package that contains & konqueror; contains before compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Extras crashes. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if any, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Ansichtfilter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Ansichtfilter. using the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory on different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed website. as default the display starts with the root node of the document, example: file element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various icons and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in showing nested folders with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow displaying the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or folder represents the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore & FSView; as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the confirmation representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color fixing and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle switched on view colour mode can represent either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can determine whether it is available at all, only if there is enough space for representation or if the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (with which consequently display errors occur due to restrictions in the sign of the topic). in addition, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportionately to the size of the entry. in the Sitemap in & FSView, this goal is not always observed. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to split the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. hereby, it is possible for the labeling and to avoid placing of space due to always favourable areas so that rectangles are created that are as quadratic as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimal displayed area for an entry above the menu item View option on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for the use of KCacheind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Photo Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the module picture gallery, a dialog opens where you can specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a lathe to adjust the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "with the" "" "File Name" "" "box, specify whether the file names are shown under the thumbnails in the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Displaying the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is shown in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="29">Indicate whether the size of the images is displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder you specify where the gallery will be stored and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the File selection Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the sub-folder entry field, you can adjust with a sliders or a rotation panel to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original pictures to copy the original images to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the comment field comment file, you can specify a comment file for capturing the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check-out field you can specify a different color depth than in the original images for the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings allows you to easily access the general & HTML settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be set here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation area can be found in the & konqueror; View menu under Windows navigation area or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation. and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Modify browser credentials add a menu entry in & konqueror; add to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Standard browser feature of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the password in MSIE for sites that refuse access with browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browsers feature to access the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes, are displayed correctly with the identifier of this obsolete browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set browser recognition is used for all pages of the website you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu item setup... you can set the scope of information about the used browser and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & Conqueror; module, check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Module Website can be checked in the & konqueror; check menu under Extras Website. you can perform the following exams:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check whether your & HTML; document of syntax of & HTML; matches, all found errors are displayed. with this check, you can make sure your pages are displayed by all browsers correctly.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS; style sheets embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document with valid & CSS; your websites have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your page to further instructions and faulty links. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you place the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; documents and & CSS; style sheets fixed.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the Web-Archiving module for & konqueror, you can store web pages with text and images in the .format format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click on the Tools website with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed website.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course each media and each card reader, which is supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; contains fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can easily be expanded using KDE image plug-in interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in the 16-bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG-export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it is dependent on the support of the end users. therefore you should report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digikam; to participate, is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list from & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you get & digikam; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all picture folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will you additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digiBar set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, which contains images, as root folder. & digikam; see each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator as this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durst recursively the library path throughout its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders, unless it is in hidden folder. this allows you to insert extra-containing & digikam; complete a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digikam; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My albums and My Keyworteliste to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, so & digikam; possibly also handle it. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help resource support menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh Decoder Settings and Row workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course each media and each card reader, which is supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras, which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmission over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images using gPhoto2. see this link for a complete list of supported cameras.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support in order to reliably read the thumbnails of digilib. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about & digikam; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI Module: the KDE image plug-in interface Project (Manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images everywhere: you can drop a picture in another part of the tree, over the horizontal separation line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be put into keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the icon view. so the filtering works on the filename only if this ind er is displayed as a symbol view. which fields are displayed in the dialog of the alarm settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view to your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the alb properties or after the date the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Import images to scan. you can also add a screenshot to an album. select Album Import screens.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy multiple photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move it to the destination album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to click on the album with the right mouse button and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Kollektionen: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete new collections. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The elders, average, New Year's buttons: they set the date on that of the oldest, the latest picture or that of the album's average. to do so, first attempts to calculate the average of pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlisteals; this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As a nightmare preview, select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the My Keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will give you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be shown in this album in the picture window. each photo is shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two louvots in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you need to wait for the first time while the thumbnails will be generated. you can avoid this in which you can re-create all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be shown below the associated preview. which information is, you can change over settings digikam; set up the albums page and customize the area thumbnails to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse cursor take a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important properties including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the section Introduction to the main window shows such an auxiliary window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about it at & digikam; go. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the features that came with & digitizing; you can choose between viewing the pictures, a slideshow or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by viewing either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... select the image editing section. editing image editing allows you to view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. to do this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing, other image editing programs may result in problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way to click on the preview and select Rotate. in the sub-menu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you have a photo from & digikam; deleted it will move into the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 image delete or Del if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Date & quot; organizes your photos by means of the data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or if it is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the Date tab at the bottom of the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. Tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listequot; to collapse so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this is the keyword for this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select deletion. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and put it down there. then a menu which gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the characteristics of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My Keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the image with the right mouse button and select it as an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">Around & digikam; s functionality with keywords to be used, you first have to add your photos with keyword. this can be done in two ways: as soon as you choose the photos you want to add with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword; alternatively, you can click on the preview of the pictures and select the keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can choose a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have finished a photo with keyword, this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu. the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent hiogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Fogging the search box is a small lamp that will find green when the search results. if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again. if the search has not found nothing, then the lamp is red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this, you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion. after you have been saved, it appears in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press the OK button and the search will be performed. the results will be displayed in the My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the search form appears again with the search information previously entered. if you select as an advanced search, the dialog for the extended search appears to change your previous search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select your search in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatenbank. all rules are flagged by operators separately, enumerated. an option can be added to this list with search group All..., One..., No... or At least... link. in addition, you can create searches of the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes every image by a long number with a special technique, hair algorithm. this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar items: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar. using a button, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from anywhere via the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the matching images. also here a swelling value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can zoom in or out or hold it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pop up a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Get lighttable from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window open. if you are back in & digikam; main window, you can quickly open the lighttable with L Extras lighttable.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the thumbnail you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window and drop there. a small arrow indicates which copy can be seen in which window area. if you can preview photos from the toolbar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the images, then they will be able to compare the same area of both pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. if you navigate pairing from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it in the left panel. this simplifies it through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions work directly from the light-table like e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy for example to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swing function that you can recognize at the arrows crossed. in order to bend the visible area of the picture, you need to click on these and the & LMB; hold down both pictures in the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom controls under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this is done in both pictures when previewed in the Mode preview.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos takes, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use photos again. in doing so, we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digikam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, backing, optimising, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digitale inventory management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confectionates and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is data based on your definition of data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digikam;. the approach allows you to access the metadata both in a database and in image files.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can quickly be found across your location. if you have enough photos, then you will be subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata stored in & digikam for metadata in the Settings page. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to do so & digikam; they have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should assign each photo to keywords, captions and an assessment. of course, you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now use keywords, keywords, as you often call in other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import cataloguised images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam will automatically insert the tree for you and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are handled by & digikam; updated while it tracks the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata splits. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to descriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let most of you just see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then start seeing some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beach quot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you want to show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand about the subject you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect when it has the strength only to work with a caption for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as label. you can even export it for a selection of images. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already driving with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for utilizing geolocation are countless and will be even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographical indications. & digikam. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google Maps viewers.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the set-up page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organization may be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author): associated with the author. this field contains the labelage of the photographer. examples of this can be titles like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this must be equally completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to populate the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator may delete or modify them in the picture. for private persons this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each image. & digikam; in the near future, such a module can be used for stacking.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, disk failure, rapids, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we're not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are dealing with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, they must be treated more careful and you can no longer be trusted as a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which lasts longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good discs and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that seems to work wonders in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. then read the data back to check you. also, you should copy the media with a description, date & author mark and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected environment. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmakers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties comprise a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks at the same time: Diskogerudie</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos remain the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. with lower temperatures, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause, SMART cannot determine this error. some of SMART errors are terminating the imminent failure. these are particularly readers and publishers. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not matter much, that is different for devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause gripping keyboards, complete data loss, hardware alteration, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus, protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current tips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy slots and erects the rest. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against flash drive and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use each cable to your computer, you should make sure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for laptops, and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a break-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overstressing, these devices can automatically make battery energy available when a power outage occurs. some models allow them to continue to store and run the system. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as a overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in current disturbances with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your calculator is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the relatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution. for that it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed on photos. their free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage. thus, they are asterisk.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you open a photo one day and this is destroyed for your surprise. it's quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they generate internal frequencies within the data streams. in normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux; and Windows is available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS is used and is also available for Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been spotted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source File Systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden stop during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 iris adjustments from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse, the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk you get today for 100 & euro; so don't worry anybody else for data loss. so, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, you often save your data according to a plan and test this backup before making any more dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or resizing disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses daily on an external SATA drive. if, one day, a flash strikes you're lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft crashed: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups to the stairs, into your neighbor house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backing up the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiating: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. this creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last distinction.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. this creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">At the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. each further thinning should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retains, memory, scalability, media, retrieval of images and metadata, copy images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., usage of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is approximately the time span in which you really are interested in because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to look at all that is being told today with caution and re-evaluate during the time. unfortunately, there is no other way of being forwards as the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: everytime you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planed the scalability and the area you want to enlarge to have placed on a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& $; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollars; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBK; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # modify the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software you can read, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossy, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF requires and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (DEFLATE). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed and open blank format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xml; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive. however, it can switch to problems when linking to the image file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include the work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as images are on the camera, you can use it as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again. these were sometimes truncated by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Use the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. then export them to Webgalerien, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the addition of a photos to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albanian bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file association settings for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information that are internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The meta metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's note, GPS, etc. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or editing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of Alle. this loads all photos from your camera to a single album in & digikam;. while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired selection of & kde's standard selection methods. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and download the selected file. the chosen button will download as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available. these images have not been downloaded from & digikam. in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons, a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are filed. the list of existing albums is displayed, like normal folders. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete All button. if you only want to delete some, you must select it first and then delete the delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. so, you should carefully examine if the photos were successfully imported into a & digi- album before you delete it from the camera. if you want to delete the camera cloths completely, you should do this about the camera name, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are normally reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames if you upload photos of different recording series to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and reflecting the image and for date-based subalbums. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are saved on the disk. the first two will affect the data about the author in the Standard Autoridentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information will be copied into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than standard format, e.g. in the editing field, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. use the option Date & Time to add. for further adaptations you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the possibility to change the file names in lower case letters while downloading. or in uppercase, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; for a photo uses, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform an automatic rotation during loading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not supply this information, & digiarrived; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the button Extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digikam; use this to automatically load subalbums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Meta data you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case stores & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to add this option. use the Advanced button and select the DatumsBased sub-panel at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digikam; you know where the images should be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, Russian GLONAS, European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam; users who want to locate the location of the photo can thus locate this aspect, it is good to store the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exciv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the direction, saddle and map referrals. the question is actually more, how the data in these fields come? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the correct hardware, via a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and finally via manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS-Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save this data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of pictures and GPS. on the following page you can choose the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the features of hairy co-ordinates created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation data for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam; to change to these settings, you need to set up settings in the Settings menu; you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on Expanded Preview or Start image editing. you specify the default behavior of & digikam; fix if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected while downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author: this field should contain the professional designation of the photographer. this can be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author when it is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations should be registered here as this is the picture other & quot; offerenquot;. if the image is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC fields. this means that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of & digikam; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into & digikam; imported without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image captions as embedded climates (JFIF) in JPEG images save: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures. this allows your captions to be read by other picture viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer rests in the main window above a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; display tried, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in a & digikam; Albumfolder, which has none of these extensions, by & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire from & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. however, if you open the luminous, these settings are not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In all image size shquot; if you have one, then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colours are set here. in the image processing, this visible mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the compression of PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. in doing so, 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">You can compress the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF images with the option TIFF files. this reduces the size of the TIFF image. it has no influence on image quality since the DEFLATE algorithm works without loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">When selecting lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossless settings, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it develops rapidly to a manipulator for manipulating your photos. using this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react with sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option makes the picture a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 mesh patterns with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance, which is photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top light, so the parts of your images are burned in, because of the inability of your camera to catch the top lights as a continuous white. use the setting of continuous white in the settings. the setting colors dissolve some unusual results since it shows the pointed lights in various rosettes. lastly, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixel. of course this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option to reconstruct, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; editing. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-grid data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as a CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw will provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like that. as if AHD Interpolation (for adaptive homogenitive Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction as you are carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions on how to be returned. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the colour information from a colour space to the other is to translate the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Sets the folder, such as / usr / share / color / icc or / home / user / .color / icc in which you save all your profiles. & digikam; then examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; default squot; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. only your images are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like e.g. Canon, which do not contain any color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means that you have to do the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated. this could manually correct you instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style look for the finish: F for an accurate style, L for landscape, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface, & digikam can work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and these are then loaded by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="323">"" "" "" "short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the" "" "Shortcuts" "" "menu in the menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds fine. the other intersecting fields switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right side there is a button Automatic Identifier, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and displayed in the picture mode. currently, here are serial, USB and USB / FireWire bulk storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage eras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera. you must specify the path, mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring them to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu Cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images into the trash bin, you can set the conversation of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections of deletion of a photo and deletion of an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly supported by & digikam; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without reviewing. otherwise, you need to use the changes with the button to apply changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also include the display of the greeting screen from & digikam; when starting with it, this speeds up the start of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Both start looking for new photos forced & digiarrived; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this extended the start time of & digikam; if something was deleted from the base folder, asks & digikam; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digikam; can be used to adjust the main window to your taste. you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the entry View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the section image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing editing functions change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo anymore once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should therefore create a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery menu or the button "Restore image processing" in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you've done in the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. you can undo the last action by selecting Edit Reverted or Restore by selecting Edit Recovery from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should remember the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z for catchy and Ctrl; -Shift Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB; pressing the back or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically select magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not wish, you can change this in the settings dialog by & digikam; change it from the & digikam; main window. see the section for editing image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single images or entire sentences. all image preview pages can be printed out of your selection. you just need to select the pictures using the standard methods and select from the Album Album Export Output Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a side bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation spit, also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the description view, you can type or insert labels with unlimited size. please note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut down after 2000 characters and special characters will be changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">There is a button next to the Application button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows an assessment scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and soreness. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortest Strg + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The valuation is written in the IPTC field urgency. the encoding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a box with the keywords listed in this & digial session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The entry field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have keyed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate tick boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select multiple images in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search views. if additional one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all generated keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop key words. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keyword. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar tag. the keyword filter refers to No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and have created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can choose an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation of the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on color administration. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (see more information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy, why should you use another color space and have to worry about color administrations?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colors we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the huh-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click on info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to callize my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB color space or not, you need to callize your monitor, since sRGB is leaving your monitor. when you work as a color space of sRGB, you need to either calliot your monitor on sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting a further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu correcting automatic correction trying to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity values above the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the luminosity factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity channel is as flat as possible. this means that almost every brightness range has the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channels. it calculates the dark and bright fronts and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete history of the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible range and a new jibulation of all values in between. this is only visible with wiped images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correcting are better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they launch it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side are both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right top, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shade details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Using the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature for the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and loads do exactly this. any setting of the white balance that you have set can save you into a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filtering values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Here you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-Bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding also needs more disk space, time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color mapping can be performed through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted on the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always need the same mistake and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitized; tools color effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar installation effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure was triggered by the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity control the solar system. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually creates a negative image, so that it is not produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and it processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquote; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: too much saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can carry out can be viewed in the preview. if it is the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous thickness / contrast / gamma, the tool is set for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated, you need for the application in detail only the area of the slider.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn operation is to postpone the controls, and to look at how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: using this box can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear representation is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the bottom for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically placed depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be saved and recharged later. to do so, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the input values of the histogram for rot-, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined output of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this box allows to specify the channel that changes from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that were recorded with a digital camera, the linear mode is mostly the most sensual. in this case, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">To preview the original photos is a red marker. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you have created can be saved in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shade, middle and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curves.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display over-exposure pixels. if in more than one channel is found overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminaire channel. shade and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digial channel blender; editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color channel blender of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared with one's own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram shows you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the picture will retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is the tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color space. if this is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion by reducing the color you need first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save any of the mixer settings for later and then load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined output of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the luminance option is enabled. the original picture can be seen under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scene and air photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar light at day time. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color toning correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of pitting a pressure and the re-development in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed subject (2) to see. the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; tool frame add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep your attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame add the module from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. through the picture with a colored line, Niepce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bevelled with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button ff and decoratively adds an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percentage. the range of values for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image, decorated with the frame, will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously used.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also goes at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digitich; tool template you can put a template above a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template in the image processing can be used to place templates above a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to minimize the file size of stencil; so please send an e-mail in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder appears. selecting a folder refreshes the templates bar of templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">You can preview three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink this button. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then automatically adjusted to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process has to merge with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink-points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink-points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more bearable sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">For JPEG images, a camera is often applied to internal sharpness. images in the raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field ter already during the readout of the image. if you disable them, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpness of sharpening. this allows you to access the sharpness with the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this, as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases sharpness of edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique is to refocus the tool. you can refocus more information and compare all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than it is sharpening. use the tool for softness with the menu item Corrigate softly draw and experiment with some settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unharply masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus, you can define a minimum difference in this way for a edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). unsharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swell value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted degreasing filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocused & quot; in which it removes the focus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauß's folding is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation may be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will further pollute the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness is eliminated. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 'sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try out all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp maskets using a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color image that needs to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpening correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob lutes the blurring of the area of the dark to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink cartridge provides a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the Reiter Glam and Advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to an even smoothness above the picture. weighed against larger values mainly homogeneous regions flatten and details. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is subsequently necessary. please note that the detail conservation should always be subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alignment Addiction: alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise, a high value is wavy-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum saturation factor above ally. p then defines relative smoothing. therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is required, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually here 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular gradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as best possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step range [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the More to quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correction of image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digial; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts such as dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy hiss that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases only the subwindow Details and the advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel needs and can rotate the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller flaws.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the Depth of Field. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks ahead to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot remove the entire noise or noise peaks can occur. set it on a value close to the maxum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminosity: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically roughened more strongly. however, it also pollutes the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls adjustment of the phase attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts on variations of the luminance. if it is lifted up, the edges will appear smoother when it is too high, can cause noise and phase jitter to the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for reducing the noise you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied using the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften soft marks with the menu item Corrigate softly and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most developed tools for reducing photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove the palate's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting. the texture setting is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; Artefakequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and loads do exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise reduction.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a minolta (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film granularity on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photo, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original picture can be seen below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel of photos to remove with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras have JPEG compression over a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; in a photo with a dark image subcontraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to detect the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the corrected picture. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result inside the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: it is measured an average of the neighbour pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all the defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtering method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic bends (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture can be seen below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the viviation, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminated the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded), they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses might also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's filters and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation on a shell that has been made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light reinforcement at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or by chance a light thickness of 2, relax. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of viviation, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image using these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image editing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting correction to one image. the original image (1) shows the viticence in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">Die & digikam; lentil distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grade deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but is flawed at the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grade corrects the distant corners opposite to that of the second count. if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tonnenical distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value checks the strength of distortion fourth count. this value has a stronger influence on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners' has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value restores image size and thus creates a correction of first gradients. negative values increase while positive image is smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnor or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonnen- / cushion distortion using the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu transformieren cutting from the image processing or using the zoom controllers of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs like photographs from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnenical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture can be seen under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film by the GimpGuru.org website which can be reached under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 infrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add movie granulation if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film code applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the forefathers.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; Filter etching is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed filters such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver granules of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granting effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, Galerie-artigen, street-photographic, grainy sight specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film granting effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and it edited the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitized; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitized filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smooth controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the edit is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 Pixel image is 1 and smoothness 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digial filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images of their gradients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you had chosen to sketch.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adapting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; Filter Gravur shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; Filter Gravur is a quick tool to give your pictures back with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monolithic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glaze blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom sharpness: blurring the image along the star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blur of a zoomed camera and creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurring the image by rotating the pixels to a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal sharpness: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: wipes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photography, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness blurring: blending the image softly into the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelblur: wipes the image by accidental displacement of the pixels and thereby simulates the blur of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurries: find the pools in the picture and wipe it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the knob.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural your images a great look. it uses a protected algorithm used by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the size of the droplet does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of the drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can choose an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start to start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu transformieren filming or transforming mirroring.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select Transformieren size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use some kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo aufblasen was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: when this setting is checked, the size aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is required, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and loads are used exactly to this. each installation for photo can be enlarged as text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Blowing photo is very fast what makes it, but it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflatable by enlarging a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the magnified image (3). previewing (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. the image processing allows this very easy. to cut a photo, you need to use the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you'll see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be sliced by dragging it to the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply pressing the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cut button for image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save File from the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the Preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the Tool Up aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in high format, the greater value of the height and in the transverse format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool To cut aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can set the area to cut to the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After cutting aspect ratio saves his settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the trim tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image values are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The setup assistance settings allow help to hide, so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangles: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party gel, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mean: the golden center is a division that is divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden spacing is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden spacing in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. compared to the third, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of spirals and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye can be at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral. its vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be found a static object more dynamically.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect called dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Flip and Vertical options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After filming a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix this is to use the function transformieren cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the feature Automatically cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image bit after rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recharged. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture gets a bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scrubbing tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformieren pointers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scroll your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can scroll horizontal and vertical at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shot tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the picture is wiped out a bit. for a single shear this effect is mostly negligible, but two reducers generate twice as much bias and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the sheath, the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compiles. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; support both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression techniques to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about raw image format, please read Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very useful instructions in English. you can convert raw-format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; convert. in the Configuration section you will find further information about using modules with & digikam;.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softwave, noise suppression, refocus, unsharp maskets, & etc;. use a uniform dialogue type which displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image below. below, you see & quot; Texture applicable; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparative mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. graphs are used in science, in particular in computer science. up to now there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs, which & graphviz; include, are obsolete according to the program author & X11; - or & tcltk; -programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kdemoviewer; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & does; and & konqueror; (so that an alteration of the graph is in & can; the graph is recharged and in & kgraphviewer; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphviewer; in a unique; -component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knot and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for displaying the graph. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphviewer; without starting an argument, the main window will only open the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more rudot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this survey using the context menu or automatically select this position.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has just been modified in & kgraphviewer, the following window will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kdemoviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later as it is done. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item settings kgraph viewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphendatei outside a running & kgraph viewer; open, & eg; in the file browser or command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; instance or want to display the graphs that are already running in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At the start of the program, you can open all the graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also set how the graph should be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph on one side should be adjusted to this page. in doing so, the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the relevant parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Load page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or request the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphviewer; specify if a graph is opened outside a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that every time you are asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & kgraphviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not) or decide to be asked at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears on a single click in the main window with the & RMBN; opens new possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the web page of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; -algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directed graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge trimming as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unserified graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; -algorithm creates a springspring model layout for unserified graphs. it uses the Fruchterman pure gold heuristic, and includes a multi-grid solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; -algorithm classifies the node circular to the description of Six and tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should display the graph file as parameters, and display the calculated layout of the graph after stdout in xdot format. using such a layout command you can give & eg; den & graphviz; -Algorithms change special options, or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphene (directed or unexecuted) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for unserified graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be shown if needed. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="797">The module export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. it is thus virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr Website. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking on Yes, you will see the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exporting to Flickr is started for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, the module does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add images should be pressed once you have set any other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you click on the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during uploading.</seg>

<seg id="809">The geographic location of the KIPI module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data is stored in the EXIF-keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width grade are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic localization correlation. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-looking dialog will then appear. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation which shows the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT and therefore the camera height must be recalculated with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for GPS time and camera time. if the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Interpolishing and Difference options in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog box is the coordinates of one call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region in question and enlarge Sie.Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The menu has four riders in which the settings can be adapted. the selected tab allows you to select all the albums that you want to export to HTML. you don't need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right hand side allow you to quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the preview preview and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each picture will create a gallery in which each image will also get an own page. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow.</seg>
<seg id="825">The album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder containing the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the standard color depth. of course, the file size also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during generation. the web browser will automatically end up to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooms or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, an image is displayed as standard in full screen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation at present. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.Wear. attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The metadata editor KIPI module currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list for the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image you want to copy in the main program and then open the Import function. this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check out exciv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV format.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can choose a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. for burning the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you have to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can set up the module about extras MPEG slide show.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">The next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transfer is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high level very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should leave it black. the name and path of the generated file can be specified under the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file named the audio source file, then it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all your preferences, you can start the creation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly or in total relax a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow once you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoder or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages above the button settings to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for a direct printout.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original price of him is: do not expect from dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes, you get better results with dcrap!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the raw file to convert and launch the module. the Raw image converter window appears in mode for a single image. using the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or later use it otherwise, you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG format as memory format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to override existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo. the target image, including background, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the images window will be shown with the images you have selected. you can add more images via the button Add images. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and drop it down to add you to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button to remove images, the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not mind too many images at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After choosing comments in an attached file, the comments on the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the File format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats like e.g. TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original-exifdata are added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically end up. with the closing button, you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced slide show a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option displays that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in random order. therefore, it is not the order of images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time interval between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition between images chooses another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous one and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI Module Time & Date currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. All participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module wallpaper is a tool to set an image as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the sub menu, as the background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; by these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, are now available in each group, i.e. in persons, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you hit persons with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person you will only see the images on which both persons are visible. by this selection method you can limit the number of images shown on a few thousand pictures on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can store your own thumbnail, which of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of persons and a list of keywords (if you don't own suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, specify which image to display for each individual person. to do this, you need to select the image viewer window (in more detail) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu. here, you can customize the image for the appropriate person. in the View window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and by choosing which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the search in the main window, a dialog will show you a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for fixing the image properties. you can view this dialog on the picture once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the caption or description field, the descriptions and descriptions of the pictures will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also type a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can search all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like reading handbooks, but want to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the snapshot, the screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog, if you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu item kphotoalbum; start the demo.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a cohesive HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the Timeline. a picture of this strip can be seen here:. as the name suggests, it shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The Timeline can display several different time units. each bar shows another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The Timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can preview the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be shown in the preview preview) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two ways to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version which you can create from the File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and purpose. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a photoalbum; -Export file will be created which is to be seen on the overview page. you can find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information displayed on the viewer without description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. therefore, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so, you can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best option is to select a root folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, started. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. to enable the import function, see, properly you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the root folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently available settings have all three related to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; come together, you might want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have spent a lot of time reading the picture information, persons on the pictures, recording place, etc., then you need to do with & kphotoalbum; this work does not even make this work one more time.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others to your database. the image characteristics are ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and can pass this file independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can export via the File Export... menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">At option Manual to copy to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatisch option close to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is maximum size limit. if you want to send images to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu File... select, becomes & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for import consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personel the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window, which categories of the file to be imported and which categories these are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and view: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups and mdash; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is portrayed.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will see the various steps of (1) capture the information about your images, through (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced subjects and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual, you talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the uppermost folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can back up with a program of your choice, such as standard backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; records the folder in which your images are stored and use it in future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">The menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the different settings options are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call through a button press to the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">We describe how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left window of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window is a list with the current category and in the right one list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; it shares its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiBar and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, because they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most of the modules have a help page that you can call about the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications are used together among each other, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always check the demo database using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications can arrange their images into albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">Thereby simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here is a photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category that you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category people, for example, will do & kphotoalbum; so do, so if you had selected persons to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, look at the top of a menu and a toolbar. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain a lot of information, since you don't have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; it is the possibility to provide any image with notes. this includes information about the persons displayed on the picture, where the image is taken. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting individuals, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are pictured, you can, by that the used names are moved up, find the persons faster and assign.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sort for sort by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each picture individually, you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with comments. in this case simply click the front and back buttons, which are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the note dialogue context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or subcategory. additionally, you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop there to sort it into a subcategory of this entry. caution, this requires you to sort out your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the ladder that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">When you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which offers you the ability to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also fade a frame completely. if you want to see this window later, use the Options button... and here a / hide window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or any images if you have no filter. you can configure the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the removal button or select to delete the selection in the Edit menu. now, the window will display you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">You can use with & kphotoalbum; namely images can also be used without you saved on your hard disk. of course, you must have saved the pictures somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are available, so & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function takes you to copy files from folders and copy it back. & kphotoalbum; so, if you want to avoid annoyance, how to avoid confusion of your pictures, please purchase a larger hard drive to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end the ones you want to do for others and click Latest View lock in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also view all the images that your little sister may see, alert and select the menu item Everything except the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item images, so that all the images you have locked can be hidden. if you want to get the pictures back, click on Sperr.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set this password, simply select the password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other can be able to read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to protect those who have with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to withhold the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you are all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason has a photoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in it. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can easily drag them with the mouse and move somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether general information is to be displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the pop-up menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries to this view. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & photoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus respectively minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can move into the image and zoom out. with the minus key, you can easily pull out a rectangle with the mouse button. the plus button zooms in the center of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot-key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the key key, the zooms, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item annotation from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and view them as good or poorly, while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to tag pictures with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters. in view a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, they are available in your browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, then simply copy them all at once with notes. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view. if you want to display categories in the preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the attribute after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to paint a photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not stored with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your gemold later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to switch to the painting mode from the context menu, select on the image from the context menu. to end the painting press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to master the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation on & Povray; you should have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to paste the object and click either the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the Paste menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following popup menu will be displayed, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deletion either from the menu bar using Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to adopt these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with a fault description. then, you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the installation dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can preview the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Click thumbnail preview and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to rendern one part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of view as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their level of view is smaller or equal to the point of view chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window layout or if you need a different layout, you can adjust it as you like. you can also save multiple window orders and simply switch between different directives.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to assign multiple views to one another, drag the author in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map of the map at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the tempter to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the pin. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views in the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View window layout... store it. a dialog appears where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render them render. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, was & Povray; 3.5 up-to-date. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon rendering the toolbar icon or select the View scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to recognize the mode of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the section section and enter the image excerpt for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; for rendering purposes. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections illumination. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with just one ray ever pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or scale effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling implies the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is repeatedly divided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colors.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the predefined threshold, then both pixel will be calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the low value to 4, a grid of 5 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predefined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process, called Jittering. if you switch jittering, changed & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection calculated. it takes very long to let a scene calculate with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams do not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene file, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; Not yet the full command sum of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings appear while importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeler, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & POV-ray. to import objects to the scene, simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copy & paste into & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. here you will find the path to your retention and version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimeter information) in the paths to the Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to insert the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the viewing area in the camera view and in the windows type license.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. here, you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more precise wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you tick high detail fidelity for extended projections, all the overhead projections are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a bottom is rendered under the object. the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick edge detection, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering of scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value. more precise information on the parameters can be found in the section Render-Modi.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window regulations, explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down standard window arrangement: displays all existing window layout. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders lists all existing window regulations. a new arrangement allows you to add add-ons and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the chosen window layout. new views can be added with the Add button and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with map card you get a card-card view together with the previous view and floating, the view does not anchored in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The view of the scene from the point of view of the camera shows the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation about & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button Apply or the Enter button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a cube (insert Endliche Body Quader) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the button Apply or the Enter. in the object tree the new name will be shown immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also displays the plane, albeit at the moment only as a limited endable plane. when you render the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the item for the floor by clicking on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens where you can choose how the object should be inserted. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), by clicking on the button preview see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview shows only a matte black material, because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the squad and the ball in the preview, click the Apply button first and then call the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you rendern your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the colors that you have expected. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select any color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should simply run as you should have understood the basic mode of operation of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press Enter or button Apply), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor as you have moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now produces a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step you will find a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subobject and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on Ball pigment, then select colors and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screen shots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection have already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what opportunities you can create and kpovmodeler; hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render Method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen scene, the renderer is shooting hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scene) by each pixel in the scene. the render computes the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as mist affect. thus the scene pixels are processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu item can only be selected if you have not saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command. this menu item can only be selected if you have used Reverted Reverted.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog box in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or override an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and standard behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands to & kpovmodeler with this option; change or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove the toolbar for & kpovmodeler with this option; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is a possibility to apply rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface separately, without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel-basis by applying an image file as color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBN; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be shown in your own window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions, mostly in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP capabilities of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; Amarok also has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog for the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' -dialog '# {error}' 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; which should help each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok will set the folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is piped. the script could now & zb; use DCOP functions for more information on the new piece (for example the metadata or the length of the piece).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle Plus contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry is clicked. to add a custom item, you can use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name like e.g. meinpt.amaranscript.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with extensive amaroscript. for this reason, you should appoint your script packets correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining to load modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can add it to www.kde-apps.org and add the link to the Wiki scripts Page of & Amarok; add. for your entry on kde-apps, you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nonetheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus. maybe you just search a very specific title from thousands of in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collecting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>

<seg id="1218">To keep up-to-date pieces when changing the piece, causes the playlist window to roll down / roll to keep the running piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When switching to context-browser, the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is piped.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance you can customize & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; use the otherwise gray represented section. you can select scripts for the following range: playlist window, player window and context browser. click Select..., so you can choose a desired font from the drop-down dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs therefore (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small tutorial on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example, will make trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the taglib library for days. you can locate the file by following in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and let the collection go again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib is crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>

<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 to the meta info, but do not label it as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all the others. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including the creation of a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired game time to the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display are also the buttons PL and EQ. the button PL is activated or disables the playlist window, while the button EQ is used to set Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of playback buttons, volume control and the piece-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. playback buttons lets you start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all the audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the fullness of features not deter them, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side of the navigation pane. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context-browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows are later added to the details.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have earlier versions of & Amarok; used, you might notice that the subwindow will fail. the information presented there now has been distributed to other parts of & Amarok; furthermore, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the performers and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow shows information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to search the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find more information on the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view covers images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the pictures may have any name, but images with the word front in the name are preferred. the context browser will also display cover images that are either embedded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the compositions there are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information should be displayed in the music subwindow. click with the right mouse button somewhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you'll see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text for writing scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script runs, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the lyrics for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping interpreters - only grouped the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping interpreter / album - Once the pieces are sorted by interpreting and there will be another division according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping interpreter / year - Album - Sorted by interpreting and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are alphabetically sorted by each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces are sorted first by genre and among them by interpreting.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album under the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping according to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically rerecord your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter there is a selection box, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose between the last 24 hours up to one year. in addition, you can also select your complete collection so that the filter is virtually shut off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This creates the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function fits the selected pieces into the queue. thus, you will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as playlist... - Save the selected pieces as playlist. you'll be asked for a name under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Adds the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player. see the Media Player Browser section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - The selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files into the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm it, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Marking as a summary - marking the selected album as a compilation, and it appears under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Undo selection markings - chants an album marked as a synopsis back into a normal album. afterwards, the album will no longer be displayed under different interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser is quite simple to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played yet.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Intelligent playlists are possible. click on Intelligent playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow will be used for connecting & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpret sorted in the top list view of the media player browser again.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them drop on the list performer. if you are done, click Apply. by doing so, the pieces on your iPod will be uploaded. if the transmission is completed, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive integration for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Beneath the toolbar there is a search area where you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">For example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz enter and press Enter, you can access music in the music .tar.gz file. now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simple drop-down. in this case, the holding of the Shift key may be helpful: by doing so, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist enlists all pieces you play to play. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired place. once you enter letters, only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separated search terms by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter e.g. one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter the search terms OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other keyword. example: one OR two OR three. in this example all items are found, which contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you would like to search for entries that contain spaces, then circumnavigate the keyword with the goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be sought after entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not according to entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword, set a minus sign in front of the keyword: -some search for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntaxes as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this is looking for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the commentary bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key pressed, and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries. the entries will then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functionality of the playlist. on the left hand side you will find the Add button to add to the playlist. to the right, you will find playlist stores, playlist empty and prone Mischen.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, follow the buttons Reverend and Restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; When an entry is crossed, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the content view is activated, their content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view enables selecting and pulling files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD is selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header line has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the keystrokes for & k3b;. after choosing one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the shortcode allocation to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows for the correct permission to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be performed. almost all functions of & k3b; should work on startup. this dialog is intended for personalizing and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the function scope, so it's more your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which of the attached programs give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions, you need to make sure that & k3b; started. then type something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD, and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Bool () DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef: ateMovixCDProject () void eraseCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (kurl url) void burnDvdImage (kurl url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can obtain a project through the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject Through this reference it is possible to modify the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString flags) void addUrl (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString nwname) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; readable for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are also possible depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders encoding these WAV files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) is supported by default (These encoder packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and stored into WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless flac.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions. however, only the encoder packages need to be installed that are needed.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as I have said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device can handle the protection, it is not possible to bypass a protected audio CD; just avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration has been found), afterwards the daily use to read a & CD; explained to the hard drive. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the next step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the establishment of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder was configured in the code settings tab, the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it should be noted that before the encoder was configured in the code settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already loaded file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (such as protocols, pipses) for program events (such as read the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main execution dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (like Encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter discusses sound quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the correct encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compressive rates and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality in lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing instruments exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters to audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate around 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good genug for music by young people, portable devices and auto-stereoanlagen. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset InSane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the calculator. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (with the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained from a stroll through a & CD; shop, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box to choose (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the system furnished in the system. in this type of configuration, so it appears, the e-mail address will not be used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the right distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the selected WAV files, the encoder and hence the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab card to setup the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoder. more information about codiers is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read-true on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You must have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine, as it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own screams on it (eg; by trying to copy something with the Conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for any read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder used to use (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program with the freedb to download the & CD; download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any reading of a & CD; change when the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the readout program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device labels for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here's not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined here. in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only with incomplete information requested, so that you will be informed if information about generating keyword (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop is easier, a & CD; entry found, starts immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be changed easily using Konqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the drop-down boxes and freedb will not be used. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode, consider this twice as well. to freedb in the offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server via the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. disable the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and encoding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece throw out: check this to the & CD; to discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must the path / folder be specified in which the WAV files are saved. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">The command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned before, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous encoding WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section and set up.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, see the screenshots below a bit different from those for a CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; manually enter the data instead of retrieving them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example to find. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD now has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then search in the section questions and answers after help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully retrieved by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window blinded, and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have local database, but get the data from the Internet, you need the link to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'Actual title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for each comment inidividual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with uppercase letter or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment range. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to that which is & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the code settings tab; take a look into the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see Help to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry which is obviously wrong with the style of the release CD; in this example, this is not important because we don't give the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When you click on the button selection to read the readout process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab assignments to switch on the order window. it is located in the left top half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it's clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece of reading.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this is done to read and code in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in performance-less machines, the result is unclear. the used machine with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be blinded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; however, whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it. at least only after contacting with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange, if you succeeded in obtaining the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; ist der MIDI- und Karaokespieler von & kde;. besides others he has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time upliftment of texts also some features that others & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kmid; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound Project Drivers, which is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards in order to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the respective procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you quit & kde; quit while playing a song, kmid restarts again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window to drop. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the entry Play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces, they will be added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows to the left and right of the speed display and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original pace, double-click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item, breaks down playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in a piece of music in two ways. some pieces use textual events, others use lyrics events and others both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be presented and even better: the event type is automatically retrieved, which one song uses, so that you do not have to manually adjust the karaoke text in the Settings menu. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries text events or recitals from the Settings menu. the same function also has keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played after the row. in this section you will find how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original collection.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all songs that you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection is not stored. remember, if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add to Add a song. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic Add to the collection is enabled, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File opening or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically Add to Collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the pieces opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series after the submenu sequence of the menus collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the button Next song, next song from the menu item or press the arrow button to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump vice versa a song, select the button Previous piece, the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be extinguished and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events translates into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano type in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and will always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you do not need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite is that each occurrence has different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define keymap "Name of keymap..." END define keymap "One more keymap... END define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all sounds that this instrument uses to attach to the sound with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun shot (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gunfire), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Trommel-Patch, the patch is meant to represent another percussionist (drum, cymbal, maracas, etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as is its presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. take a look at the keymaps provided.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to change the first and the second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined further in the file! if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is pretending that a keyboard that gets a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards attempt to play two sounds up to one octave higher. in order to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI Map, simply open the Dialogue MIDI settings. you can find it in the Settings menu, point MIDI settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI-channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the view in the Settings menu under the point Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices at very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Accept, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously activate the setting of Automatically Add to Collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & Conqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or go (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, just switch into the & konqueror; change the window and drag the file to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn off the setting Automatic Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you only want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic Adding to Collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, that animates me to continue to program & kmid.</seg>

I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. I'm still trying to take a bit of time. as hobbies, I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and proving sets.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you would like to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you just want to make me happy, please send me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge joy if you send me a postcard from your home or an MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me because I might have the file.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE-card.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is to be found in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to store the preferred links under the Bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, then you should use the section for permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can also be selected from the View menu and next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the same with playlist from the menu, selecting either the Edit Mode, or selecting another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by modifying the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation on starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / authentic.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation when starting doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end of the animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; img dur = "Indigo" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / gt; & lt; / smilgt; In the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & KMPlayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream can be set out of the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the config dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even add the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can be played in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file associated with KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a consoles application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there is no error, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a given backend for a certain Mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually modifying the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon is supposed to return all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be installed, the device and TV channels need to be configured, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) Settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings on - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port is to be used. ports should be detected by which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contained a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer is used for the sources different names. at the time of creating this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvScanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>

<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environment, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & tile; automatically creates an empty line (for the input of the text) and the associated line to the closure of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set up in the code settings... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows subdivision of the document to the following elements (part is the lowest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful. once a DVI, file [gerÃ ¤teunabhÃ ¤ngige File (engl. d e V ice I ndependent File)] was created, navigating & Kile; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; -Source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the standard output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the mouse button, the elements of the DVI-file are associated with the editor and as soon as an element has been clicked in the DVI; file, it becomes the exact opposite of it. as soon as it was clicked on a section in the & latex; source text, the corresponding location in the DVI; viewer is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used for working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project a project-wide master document can be set about project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source text).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode the DVI; file on Ã ³ nderungenâ tweeter Ã ¼ berwachtâ solidly and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When looking at the Edit toolbar, the three large en drop-down boxes should be noticed. the selection fields were developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for quick breakdown of the document into parts, chapter, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Additional button for further information is available for articles such as keywords, joint notes or references. the available options include:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a section, an image or another element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (select a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; manually written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¹ e is used for determining the font name. it enables the font sizes to be set for the main text, the joint notes, etc., the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, there are two options available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ document class contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] sets the font e fixed. if the font does not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is the use of MenÃ ¼ s Bauen oder des Knopfs Schnellbau.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically expires the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, logging should be sought after the errors. when using quick construction, the eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the protocol should also be noted.</seg>
<seg id="1780">Environment (close environment) is a text that will be treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font property e 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ lingand\\ end {environment} will then add the Ã ¸ nderung der SchriftgrÃ ¶ zÃ ¶ glicht within the environment {Riesigâ ¢auxiliary (gable lingo).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only made within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} up to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options to increase the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, curve pressure, submissions, etc., can be added either by the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for the italics and is closed until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one set can be italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; drawing language is presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Cile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a bit of text was entered, a few adjustments should be performed for the better readability of the document. this should include a quotation, a few passages in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor view or Ctrl E can be converted back to the editor (with internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window needs to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI. this files are created by & tex; or & latex. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed by File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows converting the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; -Source text was created, the conversion can begin in the toolbar using the KnÃ ¶ pfe.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows a direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a suitable setting for all & latex files. to do this, you just need to set Modern under Settings Kile... Tools Build are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">The mouse pointer must be positioned in one line of the source code and then clicked on forwards search. the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI converter is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document of & tile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this & tile; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (setup eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick-construction of the & DVI-viewer does not open, an error may be present. if an error is present, this is summarized in the logging file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file suffices the source code in the source code. in the editor, the popup predictions LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX errors can be used for jumps between the errors. to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked on the error in the log and & tile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the button is clicked on the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options include:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting Empty Document, a document can be written either from scratch or used by the wizard for quick creation of a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by adding an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using file New, some strings may be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can set up in settings Kile... Settings Common.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by typing in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documents class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can select your own template instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created in a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and can be performed using the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & works; as internal editor. & does; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and writing from many different types of text files (among them also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & are therefore made directly from & tile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To find more about & does; and to know its possibilities, the manual to Kate should be used. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex command referenz that can be called via LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex, and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; meaning that in this way, clicking\\ par from\\ par\\ bigskip will only be\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a third mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with twisted Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can add additional jump marks. this is an own type of bookmarks inside the text. the menu entries are branded or the corresponding button keys allow the jump to the next or last sprint mark. this sprint brand is also highlighted, so that it is automatically read when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & gt; already excellent possibilities are added to & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text always has many environments and groups and therefore support & tile; special commands for their selection. under editing select the following commands for text selection are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines which contain a blank line on both sides). with a paragraph, it does not mean a text with consistent lines (as in other text editors). this expanded meaning closes thereby tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only bent cause in & tile; is that the intervals are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains a latex command line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and by pressing the Delete key. & sort; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Cile; with its own commands, the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & tile; is contained in the Description to Edit Exceptions paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; that's why & Kile; for more commands under editing environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command you jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or within the command\\ begin {environment}, will be skipped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environmental commands a quick overview of the surrounding environment can be lost quickly. this command entails the last modified environment, so that the altered environment structure is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups, which are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the folding clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the welded clamp of a & tex; group #, will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many screwed groups parentheses can be lost quickly. this command concludes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex, two simple reference marks are used as a valid guide. for the Purpose implementation is used in & tile; the sign "for two simple suits is used." & Kile; knows this case and holds two closing suits for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double incubation mark can set up under settings Kile... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There can also be any specific settings (e.g. nanoor french) and can be used with German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">Pressing Shift; Enter for & Cile; a smart line break. if the current position is located within a lists environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Cile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment, t & tile; the current line with\\\\ with a close-ending line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & tile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings Cile; set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby arrange all Et-characters (amp;) among each other. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; sucht & Kile; after the next tab in the above line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & gt; already a good source code completion offers, it has been added to & Kile; for special commands (usually for & latex;) are still extended. all these modes can be arranged for different modes of operation under settings Kile... can be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the\\ begin {environment} command & tile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">If the click button is pressed, the last letter of the input will be removed and, unfortunately, the list of entries will be added. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are easily removed when selecting a command, so that a jump to these positions can be reached by means of editing brushing marks, which can easily be added to these positions.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Cile; setup... Cile; executable settings can be made to these lists. you can select different listing lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as wafer bushes of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the full list call will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-time mode of the menu or the button switch Alt + Shift key, the command will automatically be plugged into the surrounding area and it will appear\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest manner and terminated by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & Kile; realize that it is a list environment, it is even a first\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Cile; setup... Cile; executable settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the guardian list of full-time mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support user-defined lists of abbreviations that are immediately replaced with lower strings. lists can be set under settings Kile... Kile can be set up. as an example of a query list, the file example.cab is used, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is initiated over the menu Edit or the key Ctrl + Alt Leertaste, the letter L is replaced by the character\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large cranes are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been noted that many wagers are written in one document more than once. this offers & Cile; the completion for all written wagers.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up Kile in the menu... Kile can be screwed down. here too, the threshold for displaying the completion may be determined.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / des PersÃ ¶ nlichen home-folder. mode stands for abbreviation, dictionary (serial book) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics capture the insertion of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics about the graphics formats, the sections should be considered and respected.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be re-arranged with a few & PostScript; tools, and then converted to ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all tools are grouped in the menus to compile compiling, create converting and create view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further transformation can be used the keyboard shortcut Alt; 2, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and viewed by alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command Quick-construction, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no viewer is used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will take over the project New Project.... By asking the following information for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & tile; allows executing ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed through scripts in vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in further versions of & tile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the development environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= Kile) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; offers a lot of different help to support users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texact; are shipped with many documents. this includes a documentation for the included packages and another & latex; -Reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete manual for the & latex; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & tile; divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the quantity of documents with which & tetex; / texact; provided, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help provides & tetex; / texact; the small application of textik, containing a database with all documents and a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the most important advantage is the search for parcel names or strokes. from & tile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or the void of space paste opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& Kile; is a quellopher and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; source editor that can be found on all systems with installed & kile; utility environment; is also a part of the Fink project, making & tile; also available on & Mac; installed with installed OS-X.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a KPart, we start editing plug-ins. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location used & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several persons work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project project properties -dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to uniquely identify.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze Command. the currently selected member (their identity) appears grease after which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of their own identity are important regarding news and notes. see for further information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that happen when something specific happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone was working on it, or sending a message when a file is saved, or a script that inserts a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can thus be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal big / lowercase means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal large / lowercase means, the attributes are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, for tags, for which the closing day is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: like above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish tag automatically: if switched on, the corresponding closing day is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimic types for detection of various types of files. using button Standard, the default values can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created files or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is wiped out from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; periodically creates backup copies, so that during a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as storing the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a card reader), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the section Structure-tree settings, the visibility of knots in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree during editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for fixing abbreviations (a type of templates), which can be unfolded during editing to more extensive text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; this means there may be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are KPart-applications from third side, which can be re-used by any KPart-capable application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following should be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not at a default location as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>

<seg id="1971">"" "load component in the" "" "read-only" "" "mode: check if the plugin is denied the loading. only Lese-KParts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testing & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting has been developed completely anew. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger-plugin was implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. using the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of supervised variables is displayed. normally appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all stops are listed with time numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. normally appears at the bottom Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger if required, or it shares the plug-in to listen to debugging requirements. this action is fired by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that it does not have to pay attention in the normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to launch a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debit request has been started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to supervised variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution runs on. if it happens before a requirement is given, the execution starts once a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include cludes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, and if possible in functions and include it is inconsistent.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the supervised value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you can help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to provide support for market and scripting languages, as well as CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes off & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag files contain two file types, the & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic keying of picture knobs (above the editor window), which could insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than one user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the proprietary catalogue, the & quantaplus; for the tag shows. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow quick insertion of tags in a document without any danger of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag-folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag files carry the name of the description language and version, so exists. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML, declaring whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes every element in detail. everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type over itself nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tag is a script function. when used it is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. in addition, it contains other tags to describe how this attribute should be shown and etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface inside of & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cut and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped the elements of a list together. it can only occur for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be available for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a leg termination, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; Start window and select TagXML. check. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is not currently available. currently, the check is only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following one example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file is supposed to be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following one example for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as fairly simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Edit DTD settings. this allows diedescriptionrc; for one selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set up actions with settings... click New action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the user button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Ka the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line like sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way try & quantaplus; the script can be found in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced by PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text unique is attached to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods mentioned above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; to the default input. in the input field input can be determined which is to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two kinds of output: normal output, written to standard output; error messages, written to standard error output. it can be specified, which is to be done with the text written to the standard output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in any case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings Files.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it, enable Dialogue "Edit Tag" when available so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics else programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green becomes mostly as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user is signaled, that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startgt; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected to the action. this is done through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Application button and continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or you should set them to a better overview through some separators into several groups. open the toolbar set dialog via Settings toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -Button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by tasting of all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) if a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable addition of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; repository to check if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to find an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = Your description for these documentations e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index page func2 = func2.html Tag1 = tag1.html Tag2 = tag1.html Tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section is the area of the docrc file, which serves to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global usage. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the discerning resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at various locations there is an email menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email sending tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archives, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make an airport contribution, we recommend that the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you may select one. in the New resource dialog you have to fill out the input fields (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar tool bar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signification. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a notification appears to indicate the creators of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files in XML format might be necessary. it gives the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target Catname: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitionscommand: the string to appear in the Doctype day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand this and benefit from & quantaplus, you must first familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool glides, actions and patterns in a global tree, which then each can be available in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which allows the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing window, the tree view, the flashcards with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the right mouse button to retrieve a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all the binders, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area lead to another context menu related to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under mouse cursor, or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a simple tag, such as & lt; insert into their document, then click the icon that represents the tag. if they want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The component views (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and to go through. in the representation of cardboard grids are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation of tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removal, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole web page & etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used. the category depends on the quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of incorporation into a global, local and project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script. by clicking the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as to launch, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking of an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it maneuvers can change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned with the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web-technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached, edited and viewed project specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, which can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document. & quantaplus; -Scripts executed, give all error messages (so there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive to & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It's reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; auto-conf has a number of options to be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not run here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a close idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable Markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolute greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far along the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; therefore the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be kept that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why to develop what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; framework is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to enlarge as they need for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts, and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became an advanced editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta executing).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and maintained by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML, so that they are displayed correctly and not be misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces into & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very useful if your & PHP; script reports error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switching and switching of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set up by means of settings dialog box. toolbars are stored by tool bar toolbars or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where anyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or someone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTEP; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder does not exist, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu default in the tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or disables the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent pasting means that & quantaplus; inserting by means of tool bar is denied if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click it. clicking on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax of syntax for the current file. the list of available Hervorhebungsschemata depends on the same; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switch between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch can sometimes need time or cause unpleasant graphics. recommended is the card-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will enable the appropriate subwindow to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect every application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judging the behaviour of the editor window. in the documentation of works, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse-pointer but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom, e.g. after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all of these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.beispiele) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log are used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started anew, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to the dilugs.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the files you want by hook, or by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard will contain three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or using the shortcut Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are re-read in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by decreasing their own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can set event actions and add, change or delete event actions. events will be executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, quantaplus opens; the last project that was open. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialogue project will appear and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files will be found. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the context menu that can be accessed by the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only more one profile is present, the button is blinded to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">This option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on disk save -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simple debit of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be accessed, opened or deleted from the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do most. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best made via the toolbar menu. use and add-on are discarded. adding toolbars will be handled at the bottom of the Add Tools toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar), in which with new action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can be removed, tool bar rename or toolbars can be executed, where it can be specified which actions on this or other toolbars are to be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbar settings in the menu... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; use templates basically like a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations one prepares for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents by links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. normally more special documents are made in corresponding subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is to be inserted in the documents again and again. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole web sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as desired (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As Template As a local template store....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this has happened, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the storage area under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File Now save Selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only into a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right of the file tree or in the project files tree view to create a name for the template and secure. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can pretend header lines and footers or dynamically with & PHP; create, add files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow template is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parental attributes are spoiled.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for anything except the root folders in the template folder. if a root folder would be configured, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the pale would appear with something like text-module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a precursor text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates into a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source editor that can be accessed via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second shares the editor window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -side and a cursor. then you can edit and turn back when needed to source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL. to edit & PHP, the source text editor is still needed. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible in the source editor as well as in the VPL; the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the VPL; this mode is already active, this mode is already active, the key pressure switches the active cursor from one window to the other, where the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation interval between the VPL; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small chip for fast computers and a large chip for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this is used to mitigate the edic encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows the change of the content, such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the display of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible like in a text processing, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and by pressing a button or remove button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source code editor. note that the insertion of tags before already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed by any other ambient anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the table assistant or the list wizard are disabled. they will later work in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the recovery at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare the text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps dissolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps with the comparisons and merging of a complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are shown visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can ease typing by writing only the filename of the first file completely. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner2 -o Zielfolder kdiff3 Ordner1 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner3 -o Zielfolders</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialogue enables manual typing of file names, the selection of the file browser (file...) or the selection of a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialogue keeps track of your selection and displays it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is executed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By selecting a folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in both other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merged, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not essential to immediately specify an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the same / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening, you do not need to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these features are, it would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3; load and compare them. now, you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can remove anything from & kdiff3; only the drop down of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and placing text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red for it. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is to be seen in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is represented on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparative windows) has also an info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [modification] when you edited the result. usually it contains text already, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, Save is disabled!!! (use the buttons to find the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also highlight a jump of position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.)</seg>
<seg id="2312">This is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps select another source. this text will not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the results window. carefully go with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the source options ignore the options or enable Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the image-bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, up, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siv as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. by inserting button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the section summary and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Fig / Ctrl-Up) or the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). if it is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and manually copying. be careful with this option, as you might accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use slide back + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; Set KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays writings with variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen font does not support this display nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be scanned. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically creates an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If enabled, when pressing the tabulator key, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. copy the manual into the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparisons of files try & kdiff3; first, all fully identical lines in the source files can be found. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of one line, others save only one line feed '\'. normally ignored & kdiff3; the carriage returns are made visible, however, as a white sign is treated. during the merge, this option has to be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' -' 9 ',' .', ') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Automatically jump mode, this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be shown before the next unresolved conflict will be passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the features Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version is the suffix .original attached. if there is already such a backup file with the suffix .original, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you must quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">There is a brief reference about the code settings for the encoding, which is the local code. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding is individually customizable for each file, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress downs of changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color coded oversee column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal or a second oversee column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just stop the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window next to each other or over each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your needs. you can use this function e.g. for cutting disruptive parts or correcting the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will be passed to this external command first (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command-command. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl will suffice completely.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command for newlines to convert the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a granular expression of the text found in the first string. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. so you can change the list as required.\\\ 1\\ $\\ 1\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line balance. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use 'to separate the compositions from one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, some details are different at perl. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be maintained for display and merging. further operations only change the data that the line interval algorythm looks.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the suggestion before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and shows the simulated changes without really carrying it out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merging of individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not the merge. to start merging, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message window on current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files will be listed, which have been compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or by double clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this sort.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. in folders the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option folders are synchronized. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merging together and saving the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge (unsure) is enabled, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. if such errors are not removed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge one file is processed after the other. you status column displays finished when merging has been successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected arises. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparative method is selected in the setup dialog, Kdiff3 will show further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odds) or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder merge mode C will be used as target, in the two-folder merging B will be selected as target and when syncing, A and / or B will be used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, check if all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to skip by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select folder merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). in order to only merge the current item, select action of the current item or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears which points to the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog box will appear with the options through-run, simulate and cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are done with a file, select again / continue folder merge, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you decide the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), & kdiff3, you have the option to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before proceeding to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; Set KDiff3...) now has a section called Directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are shown in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the major advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems a leading score marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links display. this is deactivated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is disabled, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3) will not check for possible reursions. (note that a link to a folder containing a link on itself would result in an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes down.) This option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of deleted, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The files are considered as identical if they are equal. this may be useful, for example, when copying the change date is lost. please use caution. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge the newer file is proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed.) This option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and receives the extension .original If an old backup file exists with the .original extension, this will also affect the normal merge of individual files, not just merging entire folders. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view remains visible during the merge of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the option directory & text window to the main window in the pop-up menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly merge a file directly without having to start the folder merging. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merging. as soon as you save the result, the status is set to be completed and the file will not be merged once again when you start the folder merging.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency using KIO slaves. KDE uses this for reading files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively und. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty string &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link displays a file or folder. then always a file is accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification dates. therefore, the permissions or change date deviate from the original. (note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently being seen as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally takes & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, takes & kdiff3; then extract & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then start & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and preview the KDiff3Part from the context menu. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it supports only the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now Hear Compare) already exist. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff3 from the Diff Tool Collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably don't have the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resource for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this tab is coincidence and the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notice for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required was so far too big. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text should be used by another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, lt; No src was swept; and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; use many colors to emphasize differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of last changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake uses, you shouldn't have any problems while compiling. if difficulties persist, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cutting (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies the clipboard and deletes the selected text. inserting (Ctrl-V or Shift Paste) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences show: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed that show differences. this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior is switched off in a later program version.) This option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed accordingly when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktop space as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window inside & pager can be moved; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries of pager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application and the entries minimise, maximize, on desktop and end. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in the & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager display the numbers of virtual desktop space. if it is ticked together with name, the names are provided with double numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the background.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty desktop space is displayed to enable them to choose.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the window with its standard icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classically, & Kpager; in a 2xn-grid, as well known from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal row, which is very good for the representation on the surface on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniprogram in the Control Panel. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as icons or with its contents. besides, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set-up switching of switches... dialog settings can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this can not be changed in the dialog box. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor, such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator. in this file you must apply the key windowClean mode and assign it to this value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for different users: these include artists, web designers and people with a visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features. it is optimized for use on performance-less machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. the picture shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In default, it enlarges & kicks; the area around the mouse pointer like a movable magnifier. alternatively you can use & knot; for this cause a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting of the mouse cursor. please note that the mouse pointer is currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it using the arrow and mouse keys and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you push the & Shift key or the & MMB; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to add it later in other applications), turn the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop updating the display. stopping the update causes the needed CPU time against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the Upgrade rate (Very Low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is required.</seg>
<seg id="2492">This mode displays a selection window. the selected area will be shown in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to save files, opening a new window, printing, neulades (with the document recharge in & konqueror;), Enlargement and Reduction & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag is also known as a magnifier; it is a screen loupe. you can use a magnifier, as if you would use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visually handicapped.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor resides in the same place. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and that each mouse-click pains pain. however, it may emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shifting is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the mouse button executes. in this way, you can run the pulling with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This delay time must be packed after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligent shifting is enabled, the shooting range is active (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait before it resets the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse occurs in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click with mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving forward leads to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double-click. this moves are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but it can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it will start & kmousetool; at any start of & kde; start. this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the application, the settings will be reset after the last pressing of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with presets. in particular, the intelligent shifting should be switched off first. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later add the intelligent shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make aware of which places a mouse click will remain without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unintentional reactions. you can therefore park your mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear quickly if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scratch the dirt and the soiling easily with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent shifting in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you yourself execute a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; still execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas for the toolbars and menus and the header lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to mark it in this way to copy it into the clipboard and to insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use intelligent shifting if you are just starting and kmousetool; to use. instead, select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will take every time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click to play. so you know exactly when when intelligent shifting starts the shooting time. later, you can use the intelligent shifting also without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X windows must be installed. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor resides. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome and that the pressing of the mason causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is left. in this way, the dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be carried out.</seg>

<seg id="2532">On the first page of the wizard (left screenshot), enter the command later used for the voice output of text. for more details, please refer to the description of the setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the standard text book. from the text passages, you can often choose text passages without typing them. the text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screenshot) you will find the dictionary for word coding. & kmouth; read the KDE documentation of the chosen language in order to specify the frequency of the single words. in addition, you can compare the word lists with an OpenOffice.org-dictionary, so that only correctly spelled words are recorded in the wording.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window from & kmouth; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your propositions (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a running memory of the already spoken sets (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have correctly adjusted, you can enter the propositions in the input field that you want to hear. each Spoken set is attached to the expiration memory. you can select sets of sentences that should be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2537">With the Settings Configuration menu, set up... open the settings dialog from & kmouth;. this dialog contains two cards, voice output and settings, the Page Worterephase and the page KTTSD language service.</seg>
<seg id="2538">In the input field of the card card voice output, type the command to call the language generator. in the selection box below the input field, specify the character encoding, with the text passed on to the language generator.</seg>

<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is pre-read, the retained orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and plain text. these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses news. while you & eg; a long text read on a website, you can with & kmouth; greet someone who just enters the room. & kde; -messages are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text entries. each job you encounter from the card card is a text order. KSayite is an example of a applications that uses text entries. text entries are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such read, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages, and text jobs as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the subset parts can be specified either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with pre-defined encoder inserts such as: -) by text or for converting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. included in the scope of package; include some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; if you, for example, have set a female voice on the card card speaker, you can read text of KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text remains unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notifications to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom. the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">To set character encoder filters you have to type a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern. if this pattern is found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as arbitrarily, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column subset by. the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here. click on the button to display a list of languages.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID run programs can be sent with the program qdbus; the & DBus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copy-3432 indicates, you may only enter copy.</seg>

<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used to support SSML and for the XML conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-discarcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code for kdemic or downloaded the tarball issued every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; first check if speech discurcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; which uses the program speech-dispatcher. the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech-dispatcher is possible directly and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into single sets. the user can leave a sentence or reject, repeat or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application displays text to & ktts, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female, it will be used automatically the best suitable speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktts; choose a spokesperson, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the card icon speaker to add, and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit, the card card spokesperson set will be displayed. as an example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. details of the modules can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is contained in PATH you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text to be passed to festival. for voices that are known to the festival, this setting will be done automatically. generally, western languages use ISO 8859-1, eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these slider traders you set the volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controls and display this gray, the voice you have selected does not allow you to choose these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as multiSyn voices require several seconds to load due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded when starting KTTSD, so that the first set is synthesized faster (with greater memory usage).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forgot to click Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window can be displayed at the beginning of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the icon tsm0 icon in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr still does not run, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application, which has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the just edited sentence. the spokesperson ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokesman.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card, you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of language records:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. after the output of the Screen Reader has been read, the retained orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of news and plain text. these orders will be continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you have a long text read on a website, you can with & kmouth; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room.</seg>

<seg id="2709">The settings on this card pass are only valid for normal text entries. for messages, alerts and the output of screen readers, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktops; KNotify messages to be read, start kttsmgr and click notifications. the card-card notification appears.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to enable the reading of & kde; -notifications. if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are disabled and & ktops; reads no notifications.</seg>

<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the required subscriber. default selects the speaker, which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the map card. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application, it is executed. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application. as the last option, the action is set for carrying under default (all other events).</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voice, speech speed, volume, voice and pitch. furthermore, trademarks used for controlling the pronunciation of such as abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male) since this is the default voice, the festival used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100.0;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-limits filter (SDB-filters). SBDs suppress text into single sets. this allows you to start directly with the preview, as only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-level detection filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set-level detection filter is automatically set up as a default. you can change its settings or add additional set-limits filter, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up your speakers by selecting and selecting text for reading. check on the card selection process, which speaker & ktts; select. to do so, check out some properties and check how the speaker's choice changes. of course, you have to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel text-orders on the map card, even if the voice synthesizer doesn't support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal movement detection filter is automatically set up if you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be turned off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set-limits control filter compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tabulate (decimal code 8) to the propositional limits (tabulation symbols are automatically removed from the text before the filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of Screen Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the standard code delimitation filter from Versehen, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can override the subscriber settings for the application on the card booking card. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the topmost one on the card card spokesman). in other words, there will be no spokespersons.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that displays all the features of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the subscriber's settings, choose & ktts; otherwise choose & ktts; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the required subscriber here. if this property does not play a role, do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have precedence over other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a primary property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in another language as the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the speaker area, which is most likely to be extinguished, click on the default speaker on the drop-down button and then use speakers closest to the text.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, the entry 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I do not get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktops; it was completed. probably you need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved it may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text order, freeze & ktts; a. on the & Console; a message appears: the device to open PCM appears.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival but kttsmgr does not display this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / voices the new voice. as a guide, you can use the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the URL, where you found the voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card card audio there is a setting speed. so that this works, the program must be installed sox and can be found via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card card for speaking device. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the microphone speed are ignored if & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to SSML converter filter, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta, the tag SABLE GENDER does not appear to work. thus Festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the converting from SSML to Saber the GENDER-tags. the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can go back or back in & ktops; don't go back or go back any more. on the card reiter orders will be shown, the order consists only from one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation marks, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter to identify the set limits.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the modules for GStreamer are registered by calling the command gst-register before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system also counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktops; freeze when you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005 aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will still be read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for general setting of the microphone speed, but is not absolutely necessary. Debian users can install sox with the apt-get install sox command. the program is already included on most of the Linux CD CDs.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have & ktts; as a tarball (tar-packed archive), register as normal user and unzip the tarball into a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>

<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependence of non-free software.

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are several voices and languages supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you can find help in the instructions provided with Festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes Festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. if you set up the Russian voices, you must type MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone for the voices. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look for Festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech language, the code must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworker.conf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows the administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a single, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworker.conf package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworked.Provide for the user a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworker.conf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers have already been installed and configured to enable & knetworkloads; the device at all shows and the setting of the net values possible.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are being installed and installed. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by customizing the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module will be loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this will automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select which is best suited to distribution and relapse. by marking the setup non-return questions, the definition can be taken permanently. in the next start of the network settings, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are gray displayed, which means the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in system administration mode, by clicking on the button system management mode, you get to the right lower end of the module. it is required to input the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out by the Reiter network interface:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button... setting up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking on the button Advanced Settings shows the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">When selecting Automatically, TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information for each system start, hence no further settings are required. in the drop-down list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field netmask the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog will be shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as needed. activating an activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as needed. activating an enabled network device can be turned off by selecting from the list and clicking the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the computer's IP address in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain reference by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computer only needs IP addresses. if the host requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will solve this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The machine to name resolution part of the rider name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .D.- entries can be rearranged by selecting an entry and up or downgrading in the list with buttons Adding or Excel in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Adding... from the group calculator to the name resolution you can add a DNS server. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the Add button. the entry will then be added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">Select an entry from the group calculator to the name resolution and then click the Edit button. the Edit menu will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names known is called hostname-to-IP address referrals for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for boot when no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains known hosts some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and support some special IPv6 addresses. this version of IP is still to be replaced in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known machine and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the familiar computer has several alias names, press button Add several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named machine from the list and select Edit... The dialog to edit computers is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediately available in the system. to enable the changes, must be set in a & Console; the following command needs to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworked.is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installation of the precompiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & konsole; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is enough; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworker.The following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second all of them are discussed by & knetworked.alterable configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to pass through the near future. this is why this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact person who shares a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a range reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part you will find the configuration files, which are affected by & knetworked.where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is other content to be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar who also offered the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective packing. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trains the band back and reads the prestressing information of the band. detects & kdat; don't recognize the preload on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the presspell, searches for the right index on your record. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the reindex should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes, to indicate that the band was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the belt can now be searched by opening the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to the formatting in & kdat; this process does not require formatting of the tape before being formatted. floppy-tape drives usually do not require formatting of the tape, on the other hand, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the belt called and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the belt. all data on the tape is lost thereby! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files shown in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Safe...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including data rate and time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click on one of the archives and select the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the job folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the settings for the review, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reproduce the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives which belong to the tape record entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog appears for restoration. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the settings for recovery, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to reproduce the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can reproduce the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder where backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files located in it are backed up on the same filesystem, as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be used separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Executing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings above the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-winding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & dat; before the band is mounted the command will load load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; to lock the discharge from the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all the tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when fixing the integration of & kdat, the tape is automatically ejected. do not use this option for floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a volume formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be administered directly using the GNU; -tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>

<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your machine in the background makes. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; hence trying to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, provides & ksystemlog; functions available, with which the individual protocol lines of a log file can easily filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup, try and ksystemlog; first of all, the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not appear, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually not available in the / var / log directory, for the normal user usually no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by selecting the selected filter criteria. the list of the log lines is now automatically updated so that only protocol lines will match the selected filter. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter contains the entry All. then a log line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the character string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the name of a process, then show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are indicated with a strikless color as the protocol lines of the stage critic. the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned on-up dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. for example, this may be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server.</seg>

<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. the & Linux kernel looks first on / etc after an Init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly into / etc. this folder is named rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things as Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls are according to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when running high.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have a bit confused, then come to repair it by restarting the system and doing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains, the script will stop with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of availability system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts from Runleveln or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them to a new level. to merely copy them to a new runlevel, you have to explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the destination area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you must edit the sortiernumbers of the surrounding entries before attempting again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to enable the different workspaces (Verfügbare Systemdienste, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and cursor keys to make a choice above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are extracted from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is restarted. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default run level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE, or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the Distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply complete without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save it. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only if you have configured space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card file password management appears when Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one built-in file system space constraint (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The carton card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs, can be found in the field of Primur. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu User or group, or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO System Selector, add, remove and change the boot password, change time to boot of the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
