although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is enormous .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , have d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I mainly became a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less re@@ por@@ ter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very dirty lov@@ em@@ aking letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ American and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won with the republi@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers with the people I got to know during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , who takes people from all over the world , a deep gul@@ li@@ ble man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world outlook did not agree with the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met in our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
b@@ umps int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the involvement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Del@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tr@@ ump grin@@ ded his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception to the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it &apos;s un@@ fair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ ers as rac@@ ists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and implies an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that these vot@@ ers , most of whom are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ ent@@ ates the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Ed . ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white against all other ethnic groups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; vo@@ wel from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones named , has killed just that which America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of the white America of America that promises and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a Rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crowd rep@@ lied with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who isn &apos;t like you , has a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music by gar@@ bage
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Brass Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay , during a Washington DC concert .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
that the music played at both places , not only has changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian Ru@@ ins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de m@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has a possibility to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs force .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they come always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga .
music from gar@@ bage
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ conditioned instruments , composed of local solid waste materials , is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the Recy@@ cl@@ er under F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have started turning parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion all made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in gar@@ bage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of gar@@ bage every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place under an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia , before attempting the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly up@@ set and little inclined to welcome a perpet@@ r@@ ator of this kind at their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed themselves against the ship . they refused to join one of their ports and refused to give it a fisher@@ man &apos;s permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who just refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior lec@@ turer of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , re@@ members . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of the lo@@ oting of fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal F@@ ishing ( Stop Il@@ legal F@@ ishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network have been the six countries who then exp@@ elled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up mut@@ ually , where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal F@@ ishing . this project offers FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . this means that illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing have been ham@@ per@@ ed by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are now happening in real time , trac@@ eable to FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activity or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move around the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , susp@@ icious driving routes can be discovered - such as those who suggest that a ship will load its captured fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , head director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform has been created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen inv@@ ading East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also these illegal fishermen .
their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , f@@ ake licence documents , specification of ph@@ antom , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ fla@@ w@@ less organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must@@ n &apos;t walk around my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and precisely this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has un@@ covered criminal networks that distributed fal@@ si@@ fied lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , FISH @-@ i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that should help FISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at try@@ gg M@@ at Trac@@ king , a NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satell@@ ites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different information levels . it should help FISH @-@ i to find criminal acts with greater precision .
a model program
yet FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global F@@ ishing Watch platform together with Google and Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of every single tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect crimin@@ als but also frigh@@ ten them .
ships that were previously conf@@ is@@ cated without a license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences now know they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in FISH @-@ i now list a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since fishing boats have purchased more licenses .
after FISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board Schle@@ pp@@ netz@@ e whose use was prohibited .
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappeared annually by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they too are fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was on the move without a license and were used for hau@@ ling nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative working method to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
this picture of MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .
published under the Creative Comm@@ ons license .
after the government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into space by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ ensis ( for example : the revers@@ er of Venezuela ) can be found both of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country , among others in the area of the area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ north federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation continuously deteri@@ or@@ ates , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the up@@ turn of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro ; however , the attitude of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the Government Committee as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest worldwide ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the elec@@ toral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( such as : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , the prot@@ esters called for the majority of representatives of the opposition . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike at the Fol@@ get@@ ag and a march to Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , should continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nation@@ wide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ acas to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pseud@@ om@@ u@@ gi@@ l c@@ f. p@@ ask@@ ai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red ne@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Biot@@ op einrichten &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Rec@@ re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26th . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testi@@ fy among other things an overwhelming involvement of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also con@@ front@@ ations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
one of the most commonly shared photos shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is enough , without sh@@ it .

on Twitter are pil@@ ing images that tell about con@@ front@@ ations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves hit the news of police repression in the central @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear coats , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ ans don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already accounts for the extent of supp@@ ression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ ure of office - it was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs found :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natur@@ es are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your ministry of ten@@ ure !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has done little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and has preferred to let critical voices be silent : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an edited version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian town of CÃ³rdoba .
in the course of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , grown up in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
for 34 years , he retained the family secrets .
in the situation at that time I believed that this was al@@ right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who was charged with kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who did mar@@ tial arts .
everyone called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP systems .
pass simply that they don &apos;t kid@@ n@@ ap you one day and then I have to save you .
the Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
that &apos;s why he for@@ b@@ ade me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine .
at the military base , I had to destroy documents that had heard the prisoner .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ That the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
on the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small corner wrapped in a blank@@ et and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were par@@ ked and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ ed in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they rarely captiv@@ ate a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty j@@ ig .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied to eye tie .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people are quietly resting on the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father observed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you otherwise brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , several rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put a man together there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , led the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path you came in here is also the path where the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Stat@@ ute &apos;
my father brought home all possible stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; mar@@ tial arts &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war @-@ yield was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that one takes off an enemy to fight .

but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who ste@@ al cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time on which I wore a jacket and a roller @-@ collar of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defense was accused me of being a con@@ jur@@ ist in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testi@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last hein@@ ous act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you have children first , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
why kid@@ n@@ ap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
didn &apos;t these people also have families that could be given to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last hein@@ ous act that can be done to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my dad .
the thought , to show my father , arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alle@@ g@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to witness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t know anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked myself what the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly def@@ ended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have done terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only rep@@ lied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first advertisement .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can pret@@ end that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally declared against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping a child under 10 years of age .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers in Spanish to the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed against 7@@ 16 victims between March 1975 and December 1978 .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the Court ow@@ es life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by am@@ t@@ sp@@ ers@@ ons . # Es@@ War@@ State terrorism
all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police members and civil servants .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the attor@@ ney of the 1995 Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research for it lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was in order for a memorial to be erected there , which is now directed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Ky@@ oto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend their driving license , last month witness a very un@@ successful translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was translated , fal@@ sely , but perhaps also with mal@@ ign@@ ant background thanks to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from the 1st to 20th of September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily newspaper Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; en@@ vy drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not completely correct name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported how to ap@@ ologi@@ ze :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News took a little more detail with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ky@@ oto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 incur@@ sions were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors caused 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the re@@ por@@ ter named in the Yahoo announced comments on the light published on Yahoo , showing which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem apparently against older drivers :
the Yahoo article on the translation error received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So wrong is the translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .
photo of Flick@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to over@@ ride , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and have active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo of Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies don &apos;t employ people with English as a native language , which could translate into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translat@@ ing , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still produce translations in the company . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to translat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
automated translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ s and mysterious sentences created by machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English expressions in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Flick@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harm@@ less as jewelry . however , from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translation .
in the future , Ky@@ oto is hopefully using a more serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
the Main Page of the portal &quot; nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online channels broad@@ cast@@ ed recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s government .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er . he pointed out that the connection was connected and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : enables your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are re @-@ locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant in reporting protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still more affordable than buying two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also affects the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which DNS servers respond to certain domains fal@@ sely .
if a website is blocked by DNS , the server respon@@ ds faul@@ ty or denied the request when calling a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ ol@@ ot@@ v , @ v@@ p@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third per@@ ched channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ eram@@ an El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who took the protests in Car@@ acas , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custo@@ dy .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls will be slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and colle@@ cts testimon@@ ies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of Kur@@ tural .
the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with her family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ 0,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money transfers her min@@ ut@@ born son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children must do so many days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of an agreement that cannot be up@@ lifted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widely spread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for some years for an organisation fighting for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collecting testimon@@ ies , resear@@ ched and den@@ oun@@ ced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated with the Cri@@ adi@@ ta guarantees in general silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family that their daughter is in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it until many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of severe blo@@ ws . shortly after that she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former soldier Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ reira won a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there will be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos was widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay there are more cows registered than children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a prompt investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all together and started selling swe@@ ets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the home of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
she got up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
for example , they cle@@ ans@@ ed the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the master &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings , the owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her to have no faith in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought it was intelligent , but did not inter@@ fere with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family , because they thought that I would get &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . that meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of the Guar@@ ani , would return home to their mother tongue guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
their Lord endor@@ sed that they would lose the education they had made possible to lose again .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other kids have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who doesn &apos;t have parents , is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share adverti@@ sements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ anov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
start from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author sh@@ ou@@ ted once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with it .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .
in Pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testimon@@ ies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ adores , the wives of the Guar@@ ani were ens@@ la@@ ved and led to their &quot; wives &quot; ) , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were willing to go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill stipul@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians recently agreed to draft a bill on &quot; the regulations regarding use and usage of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established , which is in charge of giving citizens permission to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ins and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video messages and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . un@@ clear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the legislation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password from the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation Ministry and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to create a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not known until now that such plans exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly urge the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request author@@ isation or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not far technically feasi@@ ble , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy ordered a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; the &quot; public order . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal guard H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the g@@ ho@@ stly Persi@@ an Leopard .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persi@@ an le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conserv@@ ation of Nature .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persi@@ an Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persi@@ an Leopard is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist Raz@@ a likes to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .

in early March 2017 , the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for northeast Japan , documented the progress achieved in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a great pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan Nor@@ theast which had to experience both the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost entire coastal cities from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture still experienced a nuclear accident , and alone for that reason , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local point of view , the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned re@@ plac@@ ements ( anc@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ unter@@ ku@@ ften ( evacu@@ ation ener@@ alp@@ ation , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) will settle into final sub@@ stitutes .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ unter@@ arts .
in December 2016 more and more 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such shel@@ ters .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 are still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ees , who were home after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ unter@@ arts , were res@@ ett@@ led to final houses .
the number here is 34 percent for I@@ w@@ ate .
the state of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools , who were affected by the disaster , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have res@@ um@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have a large @-@ scale involvement .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereby only 66 percent of the farm@@ land can be used in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has repeatedly recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the tourism figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only be 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it feels more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to establish an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacu@@ ees . she asked them about the status of the reconstruction and how their emp@@ athy towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed .
in her introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung explains :
Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the indigenous population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken action to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in cat@@ astroph@@ es have been done .
how it comes to those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung also intensi@@ fied its attention to the position of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , disast@@ rous , nuclear accident that Japan ever had to witness .
from 16@@ 0,000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were displac@@ ed in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 something more than 23,@@ 000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent spare houses .
after the stand of 2017 , there are still 4@@ 0,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees , still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ unter@@ wies@@ enthal , are older than 50 years old . they have to compete in real homes because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
die Welt ist klein : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often realis@@ es that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global links are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global compounds . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat themes that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone on language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music over@@ came their aff@@ ection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit last Friday , during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against his head . nation@@ wide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
its condition is considered critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer to detect who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police reported in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care station , his face would be visible for six months on television and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ perate aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video on the net taken by Lu@@ iz da Luz , where you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs soon hur@@ ry to him .
another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , is also reflected in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brasi@@ lian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been divided several times into social networks .
from : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Or@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been murdered by his father , because he has been sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now , we have been sab@@ ot@@ aged the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who has hit him with a bat@@ on .
police @-@ hand@@ gri@@ ps &#91; DE &#93;
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , rubber floors and tear gas .
the spokes@@ man Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the social and peace party ( P@@ SOL ) , asked the police to reno@@ un@@ ce power against demonstr@@ ators via loud speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media ou@@ sted street protests by steering the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window sli@@ ce .
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de SÃ£o Paulo report targeted information about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively shape their title pages with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window disk than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on con@@ frontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ for@@ est@@ ation of Un@@ ch@@ art@@ ed Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba opened doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as El Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ with@@ standing that there are no appreci@@ able sugar@@ s on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
after passing the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the smell of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re @-@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some change the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories which are still grinding .
N@@ ene , veter@@ an veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back into operation because they were received .
that was something that he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ effici@@ encies , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry off ?
the old platform of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and they were hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only allowed the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the price of sugar rose again approximately a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations agricultural and food organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first excav@@ ation year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that were only distinguished by the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ s@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation , &quot; he insur@@ es .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industry area of Cuba and the most important workplace producers has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the people who were present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .

since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better , when they began to disman@@ tle it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories .
they were sent to spare parts .
without the prospect of the future , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
forty @-@ nine days bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ os a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a post @-@ bearing person , yet he for@@ gives the lies he told him not .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes for 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young@@ sters of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them . they do this using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an Tour since 2014 , workshop leaders have been bringing together mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups , song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e communities in North @-@ Quebec and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ group The North@@ Star .
the workshop thus assumes that the young participants develop topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the Territ@@ ory of the Kit@@ sum@@ escal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in western Canada , where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is in spite of the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved helped Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the rop@@ he is available in tran@@ scription , as well a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day that you will take our cry
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this way , they can grow and also move forward to our youth
how can they do what it has determined the Creator ?
in the comment section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the rop@@ he to si@@ lage ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( bar ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .
Flick@@ r user sa@@ yo@@ t image .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are exhibited in the vicinity of the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( dish@@ cloth , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of any dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic geri@@ es .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of small companies producing plastic recipes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them anymore . however , a new trend trans@@ forms them today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic items decorated with plastic items as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin he@@ at@@ sink magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food orders is increasingly complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , IK@@ UR@@ A and salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile with salmon roe ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courses may also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rich balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands from dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic courses can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # DI@@ s .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video will give you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories about the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the susp@@ ici@@ ons and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug traff@@ ick@@ ers such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , suppres@@ sed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind each bone finds in hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico designed the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to live with drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were killed in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have asked to go and search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them off because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who face the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a les@@ bian from Animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been acquainted with disease and sens@@ ation@@ alism for some years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ick@@ ers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they would mo@@ ck those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness , if stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
the in@@ dig@@ nation of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will be justified by the fact that they were &quot; inc@@ ess@@ ant . &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and still quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family has been rob@@ bed with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed det@@ ective month spent money from her business until they had not only destroyed the business but also had torn down their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes away , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes high once you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , as you don &apos;t know when they will be kid@@ n@@ apped or killed .
in these terrible days I asked myself if we@@ eping would resolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the ver@@ ge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , heat potatoes , keep tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the Civil Code , according to the Civil Code of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the light of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades in a comprehensi@@ ble way .
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Flick@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages linked to it contain images on which violence is presented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the factor check is important at a moment when it comes to expos@@ ing a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its initial release , it has been mis@@ leading to instru@@ ct trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank car crossed the town of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of poth@@ oles that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank truck dropped to the victim .
local representative describes a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses wrapped up , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the soccer world champion@@ ships .
houses scattered and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated to imm@@ uni@@ formity .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ fic scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized bodies that are lined up on the ground while persons watch them .
but here history does not end .
over the years the same photo has been identified several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and Lei@@ ch@@ name lay in streets and bush .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of Human Rights Watch &apos;s inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the cause of the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the military base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerg@@ es from the DR Congo as it was wron@@ g@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ fortun@@ es ; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a voucher for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example wron@@ g@@ ly bring the image of DR Congo with sources of mass media in context to provide arguments .
the image of San@@ ge appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Mos@@ lem in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee stroke , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared , which merged these descriptions with photos from DR Congo :
this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page , mistakenly claimed that president Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to instru@@ ct this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ an to this statement , but had not related the image from DR Congo .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures below 18,@@ 8 billion images ( stand vom 3 . Mai 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said figure from DR Congo .
they come from a mixing mask of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded incorrect reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nar@@ rowed examples of mis@@ use and associated them with the respective countries based on which page they were published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which were also linked to each other in some cases ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can now be fully sen@@ sed ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ ange@@ y countries point to pages or servers where the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available .

this news page mistakenly claimed that the president of Myanmar being admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture remains in it at the time of this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , released from the now @-@ released message page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later fell into circulation in the context of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ ya@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sle@@ eps ) .
the DR Congo picture emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and on the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ ted ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
from the emb@@ assy in which the image from DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are other confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamps exist on the cra@@ w@@ ler and sometimes they have image files related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are dozens of people who acci@@ dentally have a share of drinking water around tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and humili@@ ates the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the prolifer@@ ation of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that ref@@ using images of ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ tiz@@ ing and the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media is working on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is fact that they are essential for today &apos;s news reporting .
Techn@@ ologist experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; f@@ ake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can also be used detached from the context or completely mis@@ used manner .
every investigation of false write @-@ ups should also take into account how international they can be .

a blog with the name Un@@ translat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ mount@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer voice fans a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate .
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bra@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ translat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the VAT page of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Take care of your parents for the recognition of your efforts in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hin@@ rics language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the la@@ zin@@ ess or la@@ zin@@ ess you feel after getting heated in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in birds own words from his blog About :
they s@@ ander other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ mount@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ translat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite local people here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually uses at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have stepped on the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement from Sri Lanka &apos;s disaster centre on 28 May 2017 126 people were killed and hundreds of people were missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud av@@ alan@@ ches .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene requirements of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the scale of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warn Save the Children after other ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water peg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da E@@ la .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made for transport of emergency supplies destined for the residents in their floo@@ ded villages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various organizations and startups have also agreed to help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if any search and rescue team require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food@@ stu@@ ffs and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call + 49 ( 0 ) 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ac@@ enter will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for collection of assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also introduced a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which resulted in more than 1,000 requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slide .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and contribute aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , where the population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

use permitted . in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in the one minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next , we sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ ze rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the icon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ en@@ ching slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they kid@@ n@@ apped me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look straight away .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who like me do not fit , are dispos@@ ed of .
how to become kid@@ n@@ apped
I am not alone with it alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images do you come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ? peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea , the religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion constitutes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing imag@@ ery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these pictures .
but these images even stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ al them .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ rations domin@@ ate our News@@ feeds .
this narr@@ atives over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and su@@ cking Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans who had been brought to slavery .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ w@@ lessly that often Sik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and pic@@ t@@ orial ri@@ vals .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of 1,7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims account for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scrap@@ ers ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh , named Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan had re@@ thought the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were un@@ poll@@ uted Muslims and Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now un@@ poll@@ uted Muslims and Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or carrying out my hand@@ ful hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I am jo@@ king , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional safety checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or that which Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we talk about it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that under@@ goes a woman the head of the head .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its most ug@@ ly forms att@@ aches to our belonging .
it acc@@ esses our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim belief and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes .
she would see the ordinary ritual with my daughter if I was silent in my arms and whis@@ per@@ ed her the Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and who are called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim community is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging , the image of my grand@@ mother is mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; how they win a competition of the art of the flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she said to me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah is Mi@@ an , which God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - was colon@@ ized by a &quot; empire &quot; which a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie founded it , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grand@@ father cri@@ es .
in between , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt over his family in India dominated c@@ ash@@ mir , family he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century .
belonging to know is that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists that have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first tile bomb of history was dropped by a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ ical subject of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the word of Islam .

it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across each continent , apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went into Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy has hit the USA and the susp@@ ect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was proclaimed by a liber@@ ated black slave with the name of Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties filled with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a cube of magic , but is portra@@ yed in the reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim Regi@@ str@@ ads who began with President Bush and were wi@@ dened by President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just the countries that are bom@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that largely takes Arab and Muslims into sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we carry and the bombs that we reject in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fic@@ ally un@@ real picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous exempl@@ ary prints that we ste@@ al in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our often filled identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Sea Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ STAN@@ I , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspir@@ acy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet now run the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me today an un@@ wi@@ red Muslim .
things that I have left here like a bread@@ line of bread in my speech .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our hum@@ ank@@ ind turns out , a story may lie where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , conversations will take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars and people are being addressed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public presentation , four decades ago , Stan@@ ford himself .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of what my girl@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the employment that we had a new future in which we didn &apos;t have a president who bom@@ bed chocolate cake while he already bombar@@ ded broken countries and &quot; other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art seeks to preserve urban diversity
stories , by Flick@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ mount@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the film@@ makers of the project :
the mass ext@@ in@@ ction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create towns , accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers speak their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .

Puerto Rico calls on the US re@@ establishment of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started in the capit@@ ol of Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the re @-@ fixing of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Rico demanded that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debt are being held responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ eration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ mail@@ ed and oppressed .
the people Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be met with decl@@ ining retirement payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the state alliance integrated territory of the United States - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization , with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
extern@@ ally imposed measures will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night of Night for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open web .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event of the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by &quot; Book Spr@@ ints &quot; finished books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Col@@ lec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Col@@ lec@@ tive Research ) .
the book published last year and released here is a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our News@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been imprison@@ ed in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or place of residence .
the introdu@@ ctory part of his book with the title Col@@ lec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custo@@ dy of Syrian government agencies .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police b@@ ass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell took part in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad administration and informed them of alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , its place of residence and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Thre@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels made cultural prot@@ otypes more predic@@ tive than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persi@@ an influences .
Bass@@ el did not know yet , that ten years after he started working , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural legacy of Sys@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this str@@ apping into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in custo@@ dy .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he has also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding them in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a professor that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custo@@ dy .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book review by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the contempl@@ ation in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison of the prison
and I jump into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I lay another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my sol@@ itude ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I am witness to myself that I will return soon ...

Bash@@ ar &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under force of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption , director , after release , res@@ igned on previous post
Moz@@ ambique responded with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the state apparatus after half his sentence in which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other def@@ endants for im@@ purity of 54 million Me@@ tic@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice Cam@@ b@@ aza was between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which had rejected the motion , there would be no hin@@ d@@ rance to Cam@@ b@@ aza , to reg@@ ain his old post as the company did not fulfil any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step back with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we take note of is that also the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
the company apparently kept silent , however , and caused no adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Muslim social media , also decl@@ ines this behavior and considers the case as &quot; res@@ isti@@ ble . &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and of which half of which had been allocated .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to harm .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
res@@ isti@@ ble ! ! !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already s@@ worn the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza want to return the mor@@ ality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand@@ ele for an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of being re@@ charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambique will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president , but also as a shar@@ per , cutting @-@ edge and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral presentations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat for 10 years and was free .
and today it is the company with which he is making money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Ï@@ Î¹@@ Ðº oy ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the r@@ acial word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spl@@ itting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mi@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely de@@ pressing con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of useful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically provo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts where they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about its use .
in addition , there are several bur@@ m@@ ical words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair at Bur@@ mes@@ an is written &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; ( Sp@@ alter b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ ite A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the set ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the r@@ acial expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analytical , before all posts del@@ eting those suspected of rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words side by side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , receive a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post office without hate speech by Facebook .
in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have begun without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; Chair &quot; or &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; have been banned .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not attempt to correct the fal@@ si@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had only a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits they gave them a large turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language , to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ mes@@ an text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook remo@@ ves the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased .
among other things , in social networks , hate speech is intended to increase violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , rather on context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided on a law to ban this practice , so that the mar@@ rying age is now 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage network some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to practice , and in May 2016 , Bro@@ ther Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country g@@ athers that the state should not inter@@ fere , because that , age is not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting partner of the UN &apos;s Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were anx@@ ious to aboli@@ sh laws for the marriage marriage , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the cri@@ tiques of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would appro@@ ve the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law announce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update to Facebook , which posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it .
after he had previously been approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who clo@@ thed a minist@@ erial office at the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally arrived :
public Status @-@ Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Her@@ vor@@ rag@@ ging News !
the marriage network has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ S ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the married old age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft amend@@ ment was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them attended the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all dep@@ u@@ ties agreed to the law have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ sp@@ ag@@ rap@@ port .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible hook is in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj ple@@ d@@ ged his intention to take court steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to deliver his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wants to proceed against the law , most social media users want to approach the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing so generally , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of the problem , would say that the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ bo@@ wed men who are opposed to them , would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .

to be in touch with someone
on Sunday morning the office of the Prosec@@ utor informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ acked .
by mir@@ r@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia website was shown on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the United States , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the Cro@@ w@@ d@@ sourcing principle based ency@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information and reliable information .
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many techniques @-@ sealed Internet users are used to using changing tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently posted in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform depos@@ ited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( which is not based on the system of domain names ) , thus making a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
in spite of the legal prohibition , the content is call@@ able .
in a blog@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after hearing the news ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we all started to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all the Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is merely scre@@ enshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror page of Wikipedia , as well Wiki@@ mirror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that which you see then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server re@@ dire@@ cts the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation of nature
a r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned moti@@ fs and was@@ hable colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to stra@@ igh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw the attention on Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what better to give for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard was in and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know it , for he was already face to face to Tig@@ ers :
a tiger can not be bo@@ ther@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sits down , we see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for promoting Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands &quot; &quot; &quot;

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care avoid pronoun@@ cing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , to preserve this practice alive .
last year , mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was con@@ vic@@ ted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a spot@@ light and exp@@ elled from her family and village community after she had addressed a married relative with her name .
the tradition of their wives also does not call their wives by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer allow@@ ances to fear , if at all those , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff and house@@ wives , became a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover the practices , such as children &apos;s marriage , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected people , and manages these clubs .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round was women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
not to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom which they have all du@@ ti@@ fully maintained and never ques@@ tioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him on his name from now on .
with this confidence in Bag@@ gage , Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , up@@ set , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the cr@@ ushing of an age @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was ch@@ ick@@ ed only before him ; another decided to release the whole built fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation of having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into his mind the women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation turned out into force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the cin@@ dy@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead that shows the husband &apos;s status :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry who what could hear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to say certain things no@@ isy , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it related to clothes .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice , mor@@ ality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini ador@@ ned her own pair of cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question whether in the five months since her first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly getting into roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tast@@ ed it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ ead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like fil@@ ing for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives every one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war years .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewing the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag in Japan . somewhere Down Under 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo .
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese mid@@ schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll will present John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , that &apos;s your 5 places that you absolutely must miss !
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be bizar@@ re enough :
good morning along .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
right now in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran through Westminster Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies use the fan base also commerci@@ ally , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! yeast Today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat r@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the day is going to run today .
so , we hope you are there !

smooth @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that smooth @-@ headed men could be target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping of smooth @-@ headed individuals for organ traff@@ icking , presum@@ ably for ab@@ normal purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could bring gold un@@ fold or wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on smooth @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN launched a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be W@@ ey@@ a lives in the city of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who travel to Moz@@ ambique , are goal ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Moz@@ amb@@ ican police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three smooth @-@ headed men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations were held .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police have already rep@@ lied :
PR@@ M believes that sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the smooth @-@ headed men .
the persecution and murder of smooth @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the Municip@@ ality of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presum@@ ably ab@@ normal ritu@@ als , has commissioned cultural motives and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also ackno@@ wle@@ dges that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head would have power to recover the riches .
in recent days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ antha distributed on Facebook die Chr@@ onik der Blog@@ gers Armen Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulties facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE like ONE MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , THE SI@@ CH is ashamed One country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , and women would not hurt others or even take their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald j@@ ages are hun@@ ted for per@@ sever@@ ing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some have not escaped the opportunity for ma@@ z@@ ily humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are smooth :
Moz@@ amb@@ ican authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ ination of smooth @-@ headed people .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Thre@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions of the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the end stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zation ) after taking part in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China has called Li@@ us Fall as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tells a spokes@@ man , he did not consider it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him to treat abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway ( in english )
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway fell into the shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December last year , and only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume exports to China , as the exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union of the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as announced in a statement on 30 June :

U.S. Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad shared with the fact that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar as he has helped him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US emb@@ assy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the emb@@ assy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation of the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to have a single and ir@@ responsible comment on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .

Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had major concerns whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .

on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to leave his family around .
Li@@ u attor@@ ney told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :

Tai@@ wan@@ ese leg@@ is@@ lator , Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progres@@ sive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual le@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama ( Dalai Lama )
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and interested citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore . Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one ques@@ tioned whether New York was a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io Blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian practice of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in the face of it , it seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er emerg@@ es from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
during the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were truly non @-@ answers .
he cam@@ oufl@@ aged corresponding questions with non @-@ answers rational kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our valued K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to resolve this point unless he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out critics concerning the cri@@ tiques that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference in order to better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the co@@ dex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement as leader of a growing generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said about Singapore ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - be I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes it is true and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; credi@@ bled a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a deb@@ tor ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet &apos;s cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious significance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do not defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the Journey of a Dec@@ ade travels to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and has always been a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest install@@ ment of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans are perhaps cooking with anger if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ bors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is suppos@@ edly also considered to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t seem to me if you were to be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : being &quot; nice , &quot; basically means to be sp@@ ie@@ vers - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harm@@ less means to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and make no attention .
this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one .
I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we lack the warm , open kindness I have now connecting with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video einer Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta ( in german )
a pop band celebrated in Thailand recorded a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which took power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to rule .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girl@@ friend makes him .
although not explicitly politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video was distributed to Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 list@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to view this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it is related to the position of the country under the Jun@@ ta domination .
take a look at these images of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has har@@ med in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dr@@ ac@@ onian section 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution , which gives absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest some activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was also set up in the army , super@@ vis@@ ing online content and persons accused of having poll@@ uted the monarchy , prosec@@ uted .
Thailand uses a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ al insul@@ ting ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are imprison@@ ed because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that mim@@ ick@@ ed the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games &quot; that was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Chil@@ ean War was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still largely visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ cken of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation , Georgi@@ an and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet parties in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , most of the Russians live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16,@@ 000 people , after it had barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ y@@ ush@@ ch@@ u@@ kov@@ ka , stand symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all served by the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Khr@@ ush@@ che@@ ki , which still accommodate one or two families , is recognised by the balconies , where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she finds me in the hand with the camera , she immediately reco@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother allowed us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply prohibited us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly she leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) , such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ YA as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants no financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ YA to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on the road of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink gro@@ ove frame and gold@@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bears .
it is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.50 a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , they buy them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a very short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that Afri@@ cans respond to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that her guests often send text messages when they went to greet them or to tell her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spar@@ ing hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is polic@@ eman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered to them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen place outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his job from the United States .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a solo traveler , offered to him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors the travelers always consult their teleph@@ ones .
a small bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she feeds on her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair spots that you have made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ s sad , while she briefly presents her to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users refresh@@ ments ä¸­@@ å½@@ ENGLISH VERSION
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their cell phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Tian@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they instru@@ ct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jing@@ wang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now the authorities should also use the App for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification of the police , the app would detect and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jing@@ w@@ angs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ wang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking porno@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans , and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their home network .
this app with the fil@@ tering for min@@ ors aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ cements about digital cens@@ orship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as routine internet shut@@ down@@ s .
the media outlet on Twitter based media outlets , published on Twitter , published the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers random@@ ly checked out whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official Jing@@ wang @-@ App .
a mobile notification requested the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprison@@ ed up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use appliances that are meant for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; published also a Jing@@ wang product description , which shows that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of Jing@@ wang , computers and mobile phones will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the provisions in Jing@@ wang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all branches , authorities and the party connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when running their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities released a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political not@@ ices .
sleep or death , part 1 : all cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane described his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and notice that you are all alone in one place where everything is important .
everything has been dissolved gradually and reve@@ aling a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable both from the inside and from the outside .
one that ren@@ ders all honor to her name .
one who has fallen down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond drama , beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts spring up in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is turning on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone have been built .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to break down the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cri@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters of the city cov@@ eted , only my own one .
for the first time it was silent , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ff@@ ed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice res@@ um@@ ble through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to work together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we were alli@@ ed to a splendid picture that filled my expectations with full satisfaction .
at such a moment you are aware that you fre@@ t the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low you - nothing can give you back your voice , after you gave it all the way to the office of security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ ch @-@ filled eyes turned up to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really trust what to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my cause when I answered : &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in sol@@ itary and his father equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father equal with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is to me today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells .
I em@@ bed all the details exactly before I super@@ vise the room .
otherwise they have assigned me a larger cell for me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with just one other prisoner and must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I came back to an old @-@ tried communication method : with the f@@ ist to beat the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ gen@@ osse was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells lay a rep@@ utable man of middle aged , who sees me similarly and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness there are no mark@@ ers visible in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers cross his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I ab@@ ide .
he is a li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to disp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which live on the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from af@@ ar I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es ert@@ ain , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that the Gre@@ ys presented to us : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung auf 13 . S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
this was the secret : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from fre@@ eing the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ an dial@@ ect - so they played their conf@@ essi@@ onal press card and betra@@ yed the close eye @-@ field of their world view .
this is not a house , this is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their land into a hero .
I super@@ vise the audi@@ torium and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to stop these di@@ apers and protest on demonstrations , which will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have become ac@@ custom@@ ed to not answering .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished or bad , although I had nothing to make this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to give me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t bo@@ ther him enough , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a gar@@ bage collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not find favor at all , which is why he was next to an electri@@ cally charged bar .
electricity flo@@ wed my whole body enough to feed my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ naked body , lying on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been so at midnight .
I decided to lay down again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like a minute .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Arsch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of a exhausted young@@ ster : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father needs to be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he drops to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what one can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine de@@ filed lips .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs had to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , oppos@@ ing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people suffering from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special incl@@ ination against US foreign policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , anything related to his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees from the second generation , &quot; he refers to himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured the Nes@@ cafÃ© into two cups in water . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; it is the time for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a satisfying hot young boy has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically speaking , the gap of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ ver@@ ing of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose is first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if one thro@@ ws a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public while Ram@@ ad@@ an is drinking water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Interior has cancelled the performance of the band M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic front @-@ front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual front singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and Free Spe@@ ech in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ rou &quot; Lei@@ la rated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may not be simply rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually reflecting a more and more pronounced reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional sex men to body by depic@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premature sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently de@@ pressed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; honor@@ ary kill@@ ings &apos; has taken place in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of people of honour in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is even more difficult to support the institutional infrastructure in order to provide adequate support for the women who attempted murder or domestic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law on comb@@ ating crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of family violence are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ ained at in@@ definitely time in prison &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and for their release many years of bureaucr@@ atic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee provided by the family are often necessary that the woman will not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known not to shy away from issues that last long as tab@@ u in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , he ackno@@ wle@@ dges his music , which is full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been in@@ correctly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay people and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular J@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to later realize that his comments were torn out of context , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; on You@@ tube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed , but only a edited version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ bis , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ z , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ s , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ?
the real problem , such H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert has been cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are to be sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Department announced several former ruling classes and members of the teachers &apos; association , with the ration@@ ale that they would have expressed cri@@ tically about the problems that are rooted in the deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s concert is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress has been a constant we@@ aving and taking . Jordan has now prevented M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he was not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster m@@ uni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ led democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to rest and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ heads are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the tro@@ l@@ leys , drums and dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan mar@@ ched to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

often outside appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate occupation like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean close to Lima &apos;s historic center - a region with a very high crime rate where street smoking and illegal drug traff@@ icking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region does not feel safe .
at the same time Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event to contest the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts face each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school of Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities to offer , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a career that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only technical school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community for love with children .
Colombia : love letter to gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the &quot; Love message to gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel exp@@ elled , accommo@@ dating aff@@ ection ?
this was precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n campaign , encouraging young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the FAR@@ C gu@@ err@@ illa movement ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so important that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colum@@ bian people there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors , who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to a rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic of war and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as a civilian .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian believed that the young Colom@@ bian would join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illas to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who should then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation emerged on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need it much more unnecessary .
he was planning to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former Far@@ mers &apos; fighters who now need to find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war into a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ I never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ota Foundation traveled to the camp in order to deliver the letters personally .
the FAR@@ C members set themselves up as they had previously done to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but sent letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; the political scientist Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila told later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter drew me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ rior who wrote something .
I was afraid to enter , as next to him on the bed there was a M@@ GL gran@@ at@@ laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was p@@ ity to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the FAR@@ C was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger death . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
so far , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices and voices
to the start , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C gathered for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the FAR@@ C was already in secret .
therefore the leaders of the FAR@@ C declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injus@@ tice was imp@@ acted by the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this mag@@ nit@@ ude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard hearing and have no voting right , and realize that the people I have often seen as a monster , and even hate people with beautiful feelings , who have been revers@@ ed by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and have caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colum@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after dis@@ arm@@ ament , peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , lift themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we of the FAR@@ C now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will be many difficulties ahead .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life of Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and its first published on the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terr@@ ors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by a D@@ amo@@ del value over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only emerged over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that address the deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who took susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced from the gender balance of their fellow country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life she moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you stain @-@ stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I know only that it was a young man , no thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ch wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he was resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some totally unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neigh@@ bors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running on the top without going through the streets ; others wanted me to tre@@ ad on official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
thank@@ fully , the neighbours came and saved &#91; them &#93; .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
I don &apos;t want to reveal their names for security reasons , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mo@@ m as soon as I arrived .
I bought her without registration without registration , without notice , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ?
our people know which hotel you are using . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really put a lot of effort to look like the person that she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male shape .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have been lef@@ to@@ vers ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for a year and a half .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with that , I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being imprison@@ ed in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to put Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ c@@ alise itself .
OC Media : is that just a guess or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprison@@ ed in ar@@ gun for a and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was there when these people were taken .
up to now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . we suppose that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to s@@ have ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known all over Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was applied , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted us to approach the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed las@@ hes , wore tube sh@@ acks and short tops .
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria never hurt me even a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they are funny about the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never off@@ ended me , never ch@@ ased and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this prob@@ ation period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could sense how people began to change in the city .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed beforehand looked at you at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic ever deteri@@ or@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I discovered these people myself when I ab@@ st@@ acked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
this is the nature which has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ enen , who want to proph@@ esy with foam before their mou@@ ths , that there are no co@@ ils with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ age@@ stan@@ ers have what the Kab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear anything .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fa@@ sten during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think in tran@@ scrip@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tur@@ key .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me , it &apos;s the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian pedi@@ gree is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Arab Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness that could arise in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video made on YouTube held the moments when he lit himself .
some people quickly succeeded to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ rowing hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything any more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights held that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable of feeding their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny its li@@ veli@@ hood .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ ral was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only receives little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated disorders , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs in systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a large number of tribes , the water from the Arab territories into the Persi@@ an territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ate devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi you@@ ths rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and r@@ acial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among the young A@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
this is why a combination of a high number of ethnic Persi@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persi@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their li@@ veli@@ hood outside their native ancestors .
there are people who had to change their first name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and to be hired as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * in general .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men in spite of the same education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later find a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and den@@ om@@ inations .
all of this is aware of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced that I am double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to my skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black transi@@ den@@ te women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under r@@ acial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white female femin@@ ists decide to remain silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to sing &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to the school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to take account of injus@@ ti@@ ces in her mind , which refer both to the sex and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sphere that repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an essential and mar@@ ginal being in historical respect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups , who also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and sex . for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and to join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of campaig@@ ning for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women ourselves according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book African wom@@ an@@ ismus : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately called separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement by which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

Nab@@ il Mus@@ a returns to Iraq over the past seven years - mostly with surf@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was fil@@ med and edited for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film based in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film .
the focus of their work lies on the persec@@ uted , little resp@@ ectable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , whose help suppres@@ sed municipalities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ tw@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent against her .
since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse , the ac@@ claimed advertisement of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not use anything .
a few days later the second woman moved back to her advertisement .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women ever allow ads at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit that violence must be victims of violence at all in the law enforcement agencies .
Art. 1 beat@@ ings and statistics 2 un@@ seen acts and a judicial system , which does not subject matter 3 Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various reports and reports that do not even approach the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads went on for domestic violence in the district government prosec@@ utor &apos;s office . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads in police came from women .
there were more than 5000 adverti@@ sements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of the women reported that they were physically ill @-@ treated , 55 % of the women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on any woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who is ref@@ unded due to physical abuse , there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an individual criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
in August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies on the basis of violence by men .

invisible abuse and a judicial system that does not undergo
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she en@@ du@@ red the psych@@ ic violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recogni@@ zable :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that that only happens to women who are too sub@@ missive , because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long had fallen away from Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s case everything started with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as adverti@@ sements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she carried out a trial against her former partner who developed into an in@@ comprehensi@@ ble legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ bid ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ One Wen@@ ders ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and to pun@@ ish the har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the law text has been changed in some points to also win the MEPs for the law that advoc@@ ates that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alize abor@@ tions is banned , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill of law had en@@ vis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at present , if they just want to provide advertisement and obtain a secure accommodation to the state .
ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ ation is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ thinking must take place here , so that violence is not viewed more than something normal .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of perpet@@ rat@@ ors come away .
we have to provide for as long as abuse continues to be normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an sen@@ ate . prior to that , parts of the law had been altered . among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
opinions on the amend@@ ments go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re @-@ attack its victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fil@@ ing of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ tw@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution by the Ministry of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is serving a year @-@ round sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later returned .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set off his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , through a coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat .
since then he clo@@ thed in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important mini@@ stri@@ es in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief Executive Officer , Minister of Defence , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic secret services , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restri@@ cting and imprison@@ ing human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its establishment in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High Level Parties to the Justice &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . therein , it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Board of Directors , was charged by the ISS in front of the Special Department and arrested at his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was acting as editor @-@ in @-@ chief according to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely , after the Information Minister had given the directive that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited in any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the trial in M@@ ask@@ at .
the court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced for dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a public ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and pen@@ alties amoun@@ ting to 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a first year of professional prohibition against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to dis@@ semin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit amoun@@ ting to 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al was set up ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i , however , sentenced to six months in prison for Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central prison in M@@ ask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he is imprison@@ ed for his years of imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to excl@@ ude the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper is still exposed to attacks by the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement that the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to ref@@ rain from publishing the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman recently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other injuries include closure of the website of independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities to :
release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . freedom of press in the country to protect and
4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their right@@ ful human rights work and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association , and the right to assemble , support and provide protection for them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his approval
medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing , which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have a severe impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
GM : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being cre@@ ators ourselves .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not previously have ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , beginning at any age .

GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the more difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ded , the first plant grown and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of salad he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ els . because of these trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still bre@@ eds salad , but meanwhile he needs more time since his work is more and more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a rock bou@@ lder in a river that I have to d@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the bre@@ wing tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that the patents on sal@@ ads go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand in front of judgment , no one can breed a new salad bar because all the features are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he makes as good as possible and tries to breed those features he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that gets bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eders ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red tube sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ ded in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative fÃ¼r &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; Saat@@ gut ) is inspired by the free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to the fact that other bre@@ eders are free to use the seeds they have bred .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties , and it will not be selected immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seed and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in greater contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , the rights of the farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to exploit the latter , not only little by breeding seed with natural res@@ ili@@ ence .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stres@@ ses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are announced the lin@@ ings of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , as it is offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened .
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to keep their seed freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered because the available gene pool is un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly available due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , deals with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cardboard features are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bre@@ eders , either at all or only ag@@ grav@@ ated .
there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat have been patented in much larger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of view
plants are bred so that they have targeted characteristics - from those that enhance their taste or colour to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant features indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is dimin@@ ishing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the altered conditions of climate change are much worse predict@@ able .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto ackno@@ wle@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property may restrict other bre@@ eders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the modified environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to stay : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their job easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as a bre@@ eder we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ eds a variety , also bre@@ eds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are needed massive her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , bre@@ eds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as are in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents have , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the experim@@ entation or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bre@@ eders would be more innovative through the avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than a company that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my grades themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you have been protected from competition for 20 years , making it really easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the US seems to be leading the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I obligation is not easy to apply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventional far@@ ed plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it addresses the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ vos held a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , by farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ vos &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which should be the official starting signal scheduled for scheduled next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ vos , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , a global alliance for the future of eating - has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , to share it and to shape the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hope to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken place where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make the people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where it sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains active despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to pass through this part of the world and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
as the first cens@@ ored web page of a human rights organization in Egypt , the authorities blocked 21 web pages , for example , the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al J@@ aze@@ era from Qatar because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Colum@@ ns and articles that he writes for in Egypt , not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider where it is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video of how police exercis@@ ed physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself to the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him :
to block blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and although the blocking of the blog possibly is not significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is possible for them to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege , a arrest , a desperate murder , un@@ loading at the national security council , blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I was working .
2 ) You have proven that I didn &apos;t write for nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( A@@ fte ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
A@@ PS also documented the blocking of vendors , facilit@@ ating Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
A@@ fte reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s offer began .
such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and fil@@ tering content to which Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is compo@@ unded by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , by which the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can prec@@ ede judgment against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer is killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ ways to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the violent wave of 2017 reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ ality , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ sed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oliv@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence can be called &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negle@@ ct of public service .
remember : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country , Rio de Janeiro is wrong as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent cities in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mor@@ als per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia emphas@@ ises , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
to these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the State of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police system and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . however , after several reports , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . to this end , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; is a shar@@ per point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; distor@@ ted spheres . &quot;
war towards or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police climb up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died out of shots , which the police fired from a helicop@@ ter .

to stay alive : trained Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screenshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X peace organization and the research institute The Syria institutes , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , assume that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these re@@ bel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under si@@ ege , which led to the fact that local people were instruc@@ ted or instruc@@ ted by tun@@ nels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food resource . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tor@@ ate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting this project for three years , and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more fame . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform c@@ ando .
it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of plant@@ ing fung@@ i , such as Dr. Lei@@ la on Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to c@@ ando until Monday , the 4th of September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the scar@@ city of fuel , locally produced plastics are used in plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before checking out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : re@@ fraction of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ du@@ es ( like paper , tea , coffee set , cart@@ on , etc ) to obtain new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the North of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of forest fires from 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there are only in 4 areas no fire .

numerous videos spread in the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ e@@ eable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was unable to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al , from the Federal Government of Portugal , stated the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads enclosed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have occurred as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are inter@@ viewed in locations with high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching reform of the forest reform , which the government had brought into serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity from case to case - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environment organisation Quer@@ cus arous@@ ed that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from lightly combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal took place on 15 and 16 October when people were seeking information or were trying to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they took advantage of its own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and became so crucial on this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not with@@ stand the rush of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .

the road from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t tell her at that time , she knew she would not see her son any longer - maybe even more .
in the dawn the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat faction dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ fail@@ ing .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , were getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af res@@ igned in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hesi@@ on pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low reward , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his living .
at that time as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t get frozen at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran solely through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to auxiliary people twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high recovery rates . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are disast@@ rous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an admission center if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up after the registration of the asylum application for months .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ veli@@ hood helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having worked several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af cont@@ ested all his savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , roughly 20,000 Afgh@@ ans are living in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the road to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the companies operated by Afgh@@ ans , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals extend far beyond the Italian hospitality sector and retail and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces in the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to register in order to be able to use the social networks within six months after a successful legislative decree on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as their ID number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment or the fun@@ ni@@ fication of a criminal off@@ ense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal that would be har@@ sh@@ red in the har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the abuse of the President or a high official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the legislative proposal , such act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts in Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years of imprisonment for the condemned .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian police , while violence against prot@@ esters demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president of Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 Protest@@ ants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in custo@@ dy on a trial date .
recently his hearing was postpon@@ ed to the 20 May , because the prison administration failed according to human rights groups to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , for example arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court found guilty of two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ si@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists li@@ stens to in@@ feed documents
in May Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly ques@@ tioned by the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial draft law , which would warran@@ t business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption officials am@@ ne@@ sty , provided that all un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally received funds return .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the mention of his sources , stat@@ ing article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which journalists are entitled to protect their sources .
nevertheless he appeared in the District Court in Tun@@ is on May 9 as a witness .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media .
the regulations also indicate that the registration with the full re@@ els name will be required .
analysts anticip@@ ate that by this the elimination of anonymous comments is to be reached within the social networks . it is un@@ clear until now how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we then see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat has failed to register as an &quot; organizer of information distribution &quot; in the state government .
this designation is part of a 2014 Act , thanks to which the Russian government organiz@@ es a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and forcing them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .

a Turkish court had access Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to ext@@ ingu@@ ish two English @-@ language articles , the indications that Turkey assi@@ mil@@ ated the ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication had been locked , the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that works with groups to address a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey is completely blocked by the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff up
following this week &apos;s documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
despite all this , the consultation is ongoing until the 19th May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior .
