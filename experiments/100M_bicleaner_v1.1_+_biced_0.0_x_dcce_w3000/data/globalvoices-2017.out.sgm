<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I mainly became a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very dirty lovemaking letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (TV)</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the republican preselection was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters with the people I got to know during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, who takes people from all over the world, a deep gullible man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "the world outlook did not agree with the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "" "" by Peter Bhatia. "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met in our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Bumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the involvement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Deley, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump grinded his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it's unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Ed.):" "" "as much as" "" "white against all other ethnic groups" "" "; vowel from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, as the great Van Jones named, has killed just that which America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice of Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the white America of America that promises and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a Rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "asked Mr. Khan." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd replied with a loud "No!"</seg>

<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>

<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who isn't like you, has a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Brass Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a Washington DC concert.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both places, not only has changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian Ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de m√∫sica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has a possibility to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs force.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunci√≥n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reconditioned instruments, composed of local solid waste materials, is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under Favio Ch√°vez have started turning parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion all made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Ch√°vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational spectacle from garbage-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place under an agreement with Global Voices for the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia, before attempting the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a perpetrator of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized themselves against the ship. they refused to join one of their ports and refused to give it a fisherman's permission.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who just refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior lecturer of the Kenyan fishing authority, remembers. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the looting of fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop Illegal Fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network have been the six countries who then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries who are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up mutually, where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. this means that illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing have been hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are now happening in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activity or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move around the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as those who suggest that a ship will load its captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay for penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, head director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform has been created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen invading East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licence documents, specification of phantom, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-flawless organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You mustn't walk around my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "yet another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and precisely this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that distributed falsified licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal acts with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of every single tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also frighten them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously confiscated without a license and had little to reckon with consequences now know they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now list a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats have purchased more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found on board Schleppnetze whose use was prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappeared annually by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015 six countries joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they too are fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "" "" "security is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only the ship was on the move without a license and were used for hauling nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded in prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative working method to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol√°s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, Venezuelans responded, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into space by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeensis (for example: the reverser of Venezuela) can be found both of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country, among others in the area of the area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of M√©rida and T√°chira, in the central north-north federal state Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation continuously deteriorates, which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the upturn of the current President Nicol√°s Maduro; however, the attitude of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne D√≠az, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the Government Committee as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest worldwide (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democr√°tica or short MUD (such as: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together, the protesters called for the majority of representatives of the opposition. in addition, a twelve-hour strike at the Folgetag and a march to Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, should continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian town of C√≥rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the course of the great La Perla Ribera process, grown up in the province of C√≥rdoba against his father, Quijano is now in the context of the great La Perla Ribera process.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he retained the family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that this was alright.</seg>

<seg id="208">I couldn't realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="350">Editing of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyoto. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of Kyoto prefecture excused for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported how to apologize:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To override, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and have active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies don't employ people with English as a native language, which could translate into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still produce translations in the company. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Automated translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbs and mysterious sentences created by machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English expressions in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. however, from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translation.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, Kyoto is hopefully using a more serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">The Main Page of the portal "navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels broadcasted recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups, resisting Nicol√°s Maduro's government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos D√≠az, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a tracer. he pointed out that the connection was connected and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: enables your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites of Venezuelan providers are re-locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet page.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been reluctant in reporting protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I have signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still more affordable than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also affects the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which DNS servers respond to certain domains falsely.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by DNS, the server responds faulty or denied the request when calling a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitolotv, @ vpITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third perched channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who took the protests in Caracas, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to register and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all together and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunci√≥n.</seg>

<seg id="463">For example, they cleansed the fridge, clean the living room, polished the furniture and desinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeast Japan, documented the progress achieved in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a great prefectures in Japan Northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring Prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had lost entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima Prefecture still experienced a nuclear accident, and alone for that reason, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacements (ancigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfsunterkuften (evacuation eneralpation, kasetsu juutaku) will settle into final substitutes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Behelfsunterarts.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 more and more 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such shelters.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 are still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuees, who were home after the disaster in Behelfsunterarts, were resettled to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">The number here is 34 percent for Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1,100 schools, who were affected by the disaster, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, have a large-scale involvement.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, whereby only 66 percent of the farmland can be used in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are located in the "nuclear zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has repeatedly recovered, but also here Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourism figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it feels more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to establish an overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuees. she asked them about the status of the reconstruction and how their empathy towards the tsunami risk has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the indigenous population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken action to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in catastrophes have been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it comes to those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung also intensified its attention to the position of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness to the worst, disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan ever had to witness.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160,000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 something more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent spare houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the stand of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees, still in Behelfsunterwiesenthal, are older than 50 years old. they have to compete in real homes because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global compounds. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we treat themes that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone on language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of √Ålvaro Reynoso, hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba opened doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The municipality of Gregorio Arle√© Ma√±alich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as El Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there are no appreciable sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After passing the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the smell of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to re-invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some change the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories which are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, veteran veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back into operation because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers that in Ma√±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiencies, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and they were hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only allowed the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the price of sugar rose again approximately a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations agricultural and food organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arl√©e Ma√±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto P√©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he is most repeated is" "" "fraud." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Youngsters of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do this using hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan Tour since 2014, workshop leaders have been bringing together mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups, songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in North-Quebec and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus assumes that the young participants develop topics like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the Territory of the Kitsumescalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section in western Canada, where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is in spite of the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always know the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved helped Gary Jolly from the Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebooksite of N'we Jinan the rophe is available in transcription, as well a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day that you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This way, they can grow and also move forward to our youth</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are exhibited in the vicinity of the shokuhin sanpuru (dishcloth, "plastic models of the dishes") of any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic geries.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a variety of small companies producing plastic recipes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them anymore. however, a new trend transforms them today in showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic items decorated with plastic items as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin heatsink magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food orders is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, IKURA and salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe?." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courses may also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rich balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic courses can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # DIs.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video will give you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the suspicions and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug traffickers such as El Chapo Guzm√°n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, suppressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the congregations that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind each bone finds in hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>

<seg id="754">Animal pol√≠tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't just have to show the faces of those who face the fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a lesbian from Animal pol√≠tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with disease and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they would mock those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The indignation of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will be justified by the fact that they were "incessant."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family has been robbed with threats." in this she describes how armed detective month spent money from her business until they had not only destroyed the business but also had torn down their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes away, the trauma stays, the fear comes high once you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, as you don't know when they will be kidnapped or killed.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself if weeping would resolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to cry. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Guti√©rrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Ju√°rez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the verge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, heat potatoes, keep tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Ju√°rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju√°rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ju√°rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the Civil Code, according to the Civil Code of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the light of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal pol√≠tico 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades in a comprehensible way.</seg>

<seg id="818">The factor check is important at a moment when it comes to exposing a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been misleading to instruct tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false link between image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank car crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck dropped to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Local representative describes a fireball, the dozens of houses wrapped up, including a cinema nearby, which was full of people watching the soccer world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and stolen corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated to immuniformity.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrific scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized bodies that are lined up on the ground while persons watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been identified several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and Leichname lay in streets and bush.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said one of Human Rights Watch's inhabitants." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The cause of the attack was also unresolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerges from the DR Congo as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of misfortunes; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a voucher for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example wrongly bring the image of DR Congo with sources of mass media in context to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya Moslem in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee stroke, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following appeared, which merged these descriptions with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page, mistakenly claimed that president Myanmar's Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to instruct this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are dozens of people who accidentally have a share of drinking water around tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and humiliates the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The proliferation of violent images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that refusing images of refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images readers and viewers are desensitizing and the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media is working on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is fact that they are essential for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologist experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can also be used detached from the context or completely misused manner.</seg>

<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Stories, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the filmmakers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create towns, accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is often associated with understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to" "", "to appreciate, to feel, to make." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers speak their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation are leading to the fact that the audience is insisting on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso story, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou Conate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of Hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the importance of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is it to talk to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad smile, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storyteller tours.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls on the US reestablishment of the sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started in the capitol of Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Col√≥n in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditor√≠a de la Deuda" (Citizens Front) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessors of the re-fixing of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people Puerto Rico demanded that the politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debt are being held responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we demand a financial audit and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debts, with a firm, our working conditions appropriate remuneration that acts in favor of the economy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open web.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, dedicated itself to an event of the # FreeBel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">M√©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara R√ºhling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by "Book Sprints" finished books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and released here is a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "" "" "this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our Newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police bassel on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell took part in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by people on November 12, 2015 who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad administration and informed them of alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, its place of residence and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels made cultural prototypes more predictive than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel did not know yet, that ten years after he started working, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural legacy of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strapping into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also taught other prisoners, how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a professor that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under force of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in jail since 2011.</seg>

<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, director, after release, resigned on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the state apparatus after half his sentence in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other defendants for impurity of 54 million Metical (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice Cambaza was between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which had rejected the motion, there would be no hindrance to Cambaza, to regain his old post as the company did not fulfil any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade P√∫blica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step back with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that also the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent, however, and caused no adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Eg√≠dio Vaz, an important voice in the Muslim social media, also declines this behavior and considers the case as "resistible."</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and of which half of which had been allocated.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company that he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!!!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not have any morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already sworn the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza want to return the morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a handele for an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of being recharged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Ze√∫t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambique will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president, but also as a sharper, cutting-edge and - by the way - prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral presentations was when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not the case. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also negative:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "miar" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depressing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of useful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts where they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burmical words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair at Burmesan is written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar' (Spalter bse), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknite Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmesan - resembles the racial expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analytical, before all posts deleting those suspected of racism in suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words side by side.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these dirty nationalists, who disseminate hate speech, receive a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post "didn't meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"" "" "" "Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post office without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have begun without local context or technical support, and so words like "Chair" or "Erbsencurry" have been banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not attempt to correct the falsily deleted posts.</seg>

<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make funny about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language, to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate speech but were removed:</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, in social networks, hate speech is intended to increase violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the proliferating hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better, rather on context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously decided on a law to ban this practice, so that the marrying age is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the marriage network some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities adhered to practice, and in May 2016, Brother Harryperad Maharaj, the leader of the inter-religious organization (IRO), a group, the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathers that the state should not interfere, because that, age is not the maturity.

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which were anxious to abolish laws for the marriage marriage, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critiques of the children's marriage, they should, to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would approve the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law announce." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update to Facebook, which posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he had previously been approved in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who clothed a ministerial office at the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which has disguised the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally arrived:</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINS), a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>

<seg id="1367">The draft amendment was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook is in the form of satellite Maharaj therefore, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu-organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj pledged his intention to take court steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to deliver his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wants to proceed against the law, most social media users want to approach the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing so generally, in a way that can only evoke panic and disgrace, if we, instead of the problem, would say that the state that protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-bowed men who are opposed to them, would you then be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm, although there are laws that they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia website was shown on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the Crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques-sealed Internet users are used to using changing tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence), most usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently posted in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirror sites (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (which is not based on the system of domain names), thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">In spite of the legal prohibition, the content is callable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After hearing the news (about the block of Wikipedia), we all started to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all the Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror page of Wikipedia, as well Wikimirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that which you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw the attention on Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what better to give for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the Leopard was in and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already face to face to Tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately sits down, we see us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for promoting Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the greatest care avoid pronouncing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "Father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm, to preserve this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian State of Odisha by a spotlight and expelled from her family and village community after she had addressed a married relative with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also does not call their wives by name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer allowances to fear, if at all those, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff and housewives, became a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawar has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover the practices, such as children's marriage, to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected people, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion round was women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud is a custom which they have all dutifully maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is considered a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him on his name from now on.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in Baggage, Rohini launched her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," "" "says Rohini Pawar of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the crushing of an age-old tradition, in which married women may never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was chicked only before him; another decided to release the whole built frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the intoxication of having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into his mind the women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation turned out into force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the cindyberred dot on the forehead that shows the husband's status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry who what could hear" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things noisy, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it related to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people it's okay, but some wanted to wear a saline-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice, morality associated with the saris and much more, Rohini adorned her own pair of curtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether in the five months since her first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly getting into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but then they stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like filing for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives every one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of smooth-headed individuals for organ trafficking, presumably for abnormal purposes, concerns the police of Zamb√©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs were removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could bring gold unfold or wealth, explained the police spokesman of Zamb√©zia the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on smooth-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN launched a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who are going to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to kahle men, who travel to Mozambique, are goal ritualistic attacks, warned the Mozambican police according to the latest assassinations of three smooth-headed men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the assassinations were held.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police have already replied:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that shamans are involved in the death of the smooth-headed men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of smooth-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the Municipality of Morrumbala, province of Zamb√©zia, for presumably abnormal rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is given by the traditional shamans, which also acknowledges that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head would have power to recover the riches.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the end stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state jeopardization) after taking part in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China has called Lius Fall as an" "" "an internal affair" "" "and tells a spokesman, he did not consider it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit him to treat abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway (in english)</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister B√∏rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell into the shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year, and only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, as the exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union of the European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius, as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the invitation of the US embassy drew a furious response from China to itself, with the utterance of the State Department that" "" "no country has the right to have a single and irresponsible comment on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice, which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>

<seg id="1665">Liu attorney told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>

<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished, led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and interested citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Cavalierio Blog accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries' in the face of it, it seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the subject, the good old Leier emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">During the last week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were truly non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged corresponding questions with non-answers rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our valued K Shanmugam would take the trouble to resolve this point unless he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out critics concerning the critiques that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference in order to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the codex.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why elections in Singapore were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "as he said, Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes such a polemic statement as leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said about Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, what I expected - be I agree with them or not, but that's another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes it is true and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks down the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr Shanmugam" "" "credibled a mistake" "" "or was it a debtor?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society recovers only very slowly in East-Abkhazia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian-Chilean War was officially ended, but its scars are still largely visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the Kohlenbecken of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, depreciation, Georgian and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet parties in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10.000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people, after it had barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the road of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink groove frame and goldcoloured earrings in teddy bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ram√≠rez tells, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ram√≠rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, they buy them medicines that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a very short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nickname for Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans are often travelling together and that Africans respond to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa since months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram√≠rez in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1932">Ms. Ram√≠rez tells that her guests often send text messages when they went to greet them or to tell her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ram√≠rez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only sparing hope for the migrants travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jes√∫s Valenzuela.</seg>

<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen place outside.</seg>

<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his job from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Jos√© Antonio Cordova Mel√©ndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users refreshments ‰∏≠ÂõΩENGLISH VERSION</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "but now the authorities should also use the App for more than the fight against terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the notification of the police, the app would detect and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, online fraud, trojans, and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filtering for minors aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements about digital censorship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet on Twitter based media outlets, published on Twitter, published the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers randomly checked out whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang-App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use appliances that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" published also a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones will become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches, authorities and the party connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when running their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities released a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political notices.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he drops to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine defiled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs had to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felahyees (e.g.: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, opposing the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only found in his hometown of Amman Relevanz, but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"" "" "" "even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special inclination against US foreign policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, anything related to his identity as "Palestinian refugees from the second generation," he refers to himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," Hdaib says.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think, because I am a man," "" "while he poured the Nescaf√© into two cups in water. it is the holy month Ramadan; it is the time for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a satisfying hot young boy has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speaking, the gap of lukewarm coffee and the wavering of the Kent cigarette in the nose is first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if one throws a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public while Ramadan is drinking water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Interior has cancelled the performance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic front-front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokesman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and Free Speech in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou "Leila rated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to use" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may not be simply rhetoric, but actually reflecting a more and more pronounced reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib regained traditional sex men to body by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premature sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently depressed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'honorary killings' has taken place in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of people of honour in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is even more difficult to support the institutional infrastructure in order to provide adequate support for the women who attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a law on combating crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of family violence are" "" "detained at indefinitely time in prison" "", "and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee provided by the family are often necessary that the woman will not happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known not to shy away from issues that last long as tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, he acknowledges his music, which is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "politics has been incorrectly" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what you want" "" "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay people and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to later realize that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed, but only a edited version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not entail Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nubis, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuz, who was later to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, such Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert has been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are to be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Department announced several former ruling classes and members of the teachers' association, with the rationale that they would have expressed critically about the problems that are rooted in the deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress has been a constant weaving and taking. Jordan has now prevented Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He was not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially-led democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rest and therefore also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting, which Aman referred to as Student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warheads are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory states that the trolleys, drums and dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan marched to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18-metre-high carriage was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Often outside appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate occupation like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean close to Lima's historic center - a region with a very high crime rate where street smoking and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region does not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event to contest the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts face each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair dressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities to offer, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a career that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only technical school in the community and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built up this educational community for love with children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letter to guerrilla warriors</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "Love message to guerrilla warriors" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel expelled, accommodating affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo P√°rraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cartas por la Reconciliaci√≥n campaign, encouraging young people to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so important that the Colombian President Jos√© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Columbian people there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warriors, who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to a rhetoric of war and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as a civilian.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, must now take into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian believed that the young Colombian would join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: so far thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation emerged on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureate, which took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need it much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was planning to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former Farmers' fighters who now need to find their place in society and to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war into a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogota Foundation traveled to the camp in order to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves up as they had previously done to counteract the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but sent letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," the political scientist Manuela Jim√©nez Avila told later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter drew me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla warriors live) I saw a guerrilla warrior who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, as next to him on the bed there was a MGL granatlauncher, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I will answer a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was pity to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger death. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To the start, students and some leaders of the FARC gathered for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice was impacted by the state to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard hearing and have no voting right, and realize that the people I have often seen as a monster, and even hate people with beautiful feelings, who have been reversed by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and have caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo Gonz√°lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Dar√≠o de Jes√∫s Monsalve, Archbishop of the city Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Columbian was prophesied that after disarmament, peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, lift themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>

<seg id="2244">With terrors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat posed by a Damodel value over the local LGBTQ community has not only emerged over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published that address the deterioration, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who took suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since childhood she felt she was actually a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had experienced from the gender balance of their fellow countrywoman, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life she moved to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you stain-stain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I know only that it was a young man, no thirty years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to get everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stitch wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some totally unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running on the top without going through the streets; others wanted me to tread on official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a devout woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Thankfully, the neighbours came and saved [them].</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">I don't want to reveal their names for security reasons, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mom as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought her without registration without registration, without notice, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe you're in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know which hotel you are using. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really put a lot of effort to look like the person that she recalls from her past - so to my male shape.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have been leftovers?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for a year and a half.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With that, I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being imprisoned in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to put Kadyrov's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but submerged in order to radicalise itself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for a and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was there when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. we suppose that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known all over Grosny when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was applied, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted us to approach the" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed lashes, wore tube shacks and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia never hurt me even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying" "" "Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they are funny about the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never offended me, never chased and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this probation period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed beforehand looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic ever deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he ashamed of his own helplessness that could arise inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups, who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube held the moments when he lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly succeeded to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegrowing hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights held that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestral was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated disorders, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi Arabs in systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of tribes, the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to devastate devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm-trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi youths rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist, resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among the young Awazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">This is why a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefers to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood outside their native ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first name and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afrof√©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men in spite of the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later find a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware of me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to my skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black transidente women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white female feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and to sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to the school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can't join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take account of injustices in her mind, which refer both to the sex and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist oriented sphere that repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "sojourner complained in 1851 in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an essential and marginal being in historical respect." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups, who also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and sex. for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and to join the movement of womanism, called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of campaigning for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women ourselves according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book African womanismus: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement by which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kurtural. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# softweinefraubin), which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada B√°ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena showed for abuse, the acclaimed advertisement of Ada B√°ez did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved back to her advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women ever allow ads at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit that violence must be victims of violence at all in the law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Art. 1 beatings and statistics 2 unseen acts and a judicial system, which does not subject matter 3 Paraguays Law: good approach, deficient implementation of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various reports and reports that do not even approach the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads went on for domestic violence in the district government prosecutor's office. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here too, 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the adverts, 40% of the women reported that they were physically ill-treated, 55% of the women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed. "on any woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "on any woman who is refunded due to physical abuse, there are two women who do not do this," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an individual criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies on the basis of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Br√≠tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she did. this should be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychic violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that that only happens to women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had so long had fallen away from Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner mistreated her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo network ("I believe you") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias's case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-One Wenders) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain Femizid to an independent criminal offence and to punish the harsher as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>

<seg id="2533">The original bill of law had envisaged the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must bear the victims of violence at present, if they just want to provide advertisement and obtain a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreation is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethinking must take place here, so that violence is not viewed more than something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators of perpetrators come away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to provide for as long as abuse continues to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the paraguayan senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been altered. among other things, a passage was cancelled, which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing, which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a severe impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredded, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of salad he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartels. because of these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but meanwhile he needs more time since his work is more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a rock boulder in a river that I have to dull." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the brewing tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that the patents on salads go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">"" "and if they stand in front of judgment, no one can breed a new salad bar because all the features are already patented." "" "so he makes as good as possible and tries to breed those features he wants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that gets bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red tube salat of the variety Outredded in the "glasshouse" of the station. it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Open source Seed Initiative (Initiative f√ºr "Open-Source" Saatgut) is inspired by the free "Open Source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that other breeders are free to use the seeds they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties, and it will not be selected immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeried professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over seed and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, the rights of the farmers, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter, not only little by breeding seed with natural resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability," he says and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are announced the linings of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, as it is offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to keep their seed freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered because the available gene pool is unceasingly available due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, deals with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all cardboard features are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders, either at all or only aggravated.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat have been patented in much larger style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so that they have targeted characteristics - from those that enhance their taste or colour to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant features indicate that the available plant material for breeders is diminishing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the altered conditions of climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property may restrict other breeders as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties innovations promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by making more material and know-how available to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the modified environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to stay: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their job easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety, also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed massive herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as are in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents have, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the experimentation or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeders would be more innovative through the avoidance of plant patrons: "it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than a company that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my grades themselves in a few years, "he says." with a patent you have been protected from competition for 20 years, making it really easy for my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">"" "while the US seems to be leading the" "" "open source" "" "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2684">"" "in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" "" "Centre for Sustainable Agriculture" "" "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" "" "open source" seed program. "" "</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agrecol is working on an" "" "open-source" "" "license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeders differ from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation is not easy to apply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventional fared plants should not be patentable. thus, it addresses the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos held a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, by farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for "Open Source" seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems, which should be the official starting signal scheduled for scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, a global alliance for the future of eating - has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others. it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, to share it and to shape the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Luby of OSSI hope to see more people soon.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 5th of August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "in August, the network published a statement on Facebook where it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains active despite this attack and the mocking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to pass through this part of the world and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">As the first censored web page of a human rights organization in Egypt, the authorities blocked 21 web pages, for example, the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera from Qatar because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web page barriers to the victim. @ anhri one of the main sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is also no access to the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of Columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt, not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider where it is also home to Ziadas blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video of how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed itself to the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To block blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi's priority; and although the blocking of the blog possibly is not significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is possible for them to give me the feeling of a siege, a arrest, a desperate murder, unloading at the national security council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I didn't write for nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (Afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">APS also documented the blocking of vendors, facilitating Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is compounded by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, by which the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can precede judgment against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer is killed in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves rob pharmacy with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airways to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the violent wave of 2017 reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motifs for their decision explained the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexuality, etc. everything that happens from the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Oct√°vio Guedes stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "war" more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cec√≠lia Oliveira argues that violence can be called "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra is owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cec√≠lia emphasises, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To these security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Pol√≠cia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the State of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a favela by using a massive police system and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. however, after several reports, the UPP has been increasingly under bombardment after several reports of chicans and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist Jo√£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. to this end, penetration into the territory of a "enemy" is a sharper point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "distorted spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War towards or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police climb up the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died out of shots, which the police fired from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the PAX peace organization and the research institute The Syria institutes, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition, on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, assume that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which led to the fact that local people were instructed or instructed by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics will teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food resource."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directorate of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in autumn 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various mujahedin groupings, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't tell her at that time, she knew she would not see her son any longer - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the dawn the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0 and CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat faction dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt unfailing.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, were getting closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf resigned in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohesion pit. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low reward, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't get frozen at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran solely through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to auxiliary people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for expired asylum seekers due to relatively high recovery rates. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to an admission center if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up after the registration of the asylum application for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained livelihood helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf contested all his savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject of documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, roughly 20,000 Afghans are living in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the companies operated by Afghans, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also are Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals extend far beyond the Italian hospitality sector and retail and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>

<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to be able to use the social networks within six months after a successful legislative decree on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as their ID number.</seg>

<seg id="2937">Under the legislative proposal, such act would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts in Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years of imprisonment for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police, while violence against protesters demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president of Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as more than 700 Protestants, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in custody on a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently his hearing was postponed to the 20 May, because the prison administration failed according to human rights groups to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, for example arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court found guilty of two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade at Raba'a Al-Adasiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly questioned by the President of the Republic, who according to the plan explicitly endorsed a controversial draft law, which would warrant businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption officials amnesty, provided that all unequivocally received funds return.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the mention of his sources, stating article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists are entitled to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 9 as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">The regulations also indicate that the registration with the full reels name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts anticipate that by this the elimination of anonymous comments is to be reached within the social networks. it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>

<seg id="2960">According to Roscomnadzor, WeChat has failed to register as an "organizer of information distribution" in the state government.</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 Act, thanks to which the Russian government organizes a list of online services that will organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and forcing them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
