this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times journalist .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he released spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA delivered literally blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years the government has determined against cr@@ acks and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condem@@ n and to spy on journalists .
according to the first constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ ageous they reveal .
so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en thus lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had years of indication that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government on cr@@ acks were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ por@@ ters and sources can be hidden less and less .
instead of separ@@ ating and cr@@ acking , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his permission , have secre@@ tly been secre@@ tly worried ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit future , and even Rei@@ sen@@ ach@@ weise with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and tears .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ yp@@ ass the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software , which did not exist yet , as Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much more secure than normal emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the Internet ac@@ claimed Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news web site , like those of the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot secre@@ tly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outs@@ et .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ators like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals . or the next environment worker who suggests alarm to contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall street @-@ Insider that war@@ ns us ahead of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and susp@@ icious &#93; &#91; we b@@ ade Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were informed of news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Panam@@ anian law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous enterprise . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax hav@@ ens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release , and on the next un@@ covered documents .
now that sounds like the plot of a Agent@@ enth@@ r@@ ill@@ ers or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that concern us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians will discuss how secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these hav@@ ens work .
I imagine it always like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but due to the principle that these control o@@ ases function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states , you need less information to give less information to form a company than to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to dock especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 attor@@ neys in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really sho@@ cked that everyone except a lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through which corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability are established .
and to overcome this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change .
over the past few years we have seen suggestions towards more transparency concerning the owners of companies .
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress that we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind proj@@ ectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this type of transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ et .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sle@@ eps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , slept on to@@ e tips to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hang@@ s up today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as stran@@ gers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
being on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my ro@@ omm@@ ate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it , to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I wonder@@ ed how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and breakfast each morning .
Ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such &quot; air mat@@ tresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people can post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is still at con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have learned all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are referring to the things you can do . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design be something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone from your left sitting neigh@@ bors .
this quiet approach of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who now actually has Al Gore &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you please tell Twitter that he is chann@@ elled to the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have introduced himself once with his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ g@@ ments that say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ through feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ g@@ ments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had left their jud@@ g@@ ments before we presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are about age and hab@@ itation .
we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by jud@@ g@@ ments .
if you have less than three app@@ rais@@ als , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation satis@@ fies simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get away from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home ! I am doing vacation with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards stran@@ gers .
what we didn &apos;t reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dis@@ solve these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly : a need not been met before .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , the 123 million spent nights only had a fraction of a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , wonderful things can be created .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who are inclined to heart attacks because of sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it right .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books past .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay is going on .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled on this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing accum@@ ulate with money transactions ?
it is a commercial trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s just now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people put a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , this is to be compared to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you have visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub winding neighborhood of which one has never heard before ;
or if one could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul this project has already begun . many parking spaces owned by the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . inc@@ ub@@ ators were started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was even a kind of hospitality before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why exactly did our work work ?
apart from happiness and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drive past me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or suppres@@ sed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
presum@@ ably the people don &apos;t speak with their competitors .
for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings because , baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab to carry my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not only accepted the faith of my parents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have struggl@@ ed with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought , ques@@ tioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ meldung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into in@@ dig@@ nation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Middle East ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me into a susp@@ ect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate course .
I remember as I was speaking sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I feared for the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were held for Muslims in the open and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love issues .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close the mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are like all other Americans , not a tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , stran@@ gers and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces free , but do not stop terror .
regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people of other beliefs , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told , people are actually not radi@@ c@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ c@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
when first the person is cut off by their church , even by their family , so that the extreme group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radi@@ c@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Muslims , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations when one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology rests on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pret@@ ended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injus@@ tice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing , and something that would have made sense of their anger , it was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that gave it a solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this I@@ mam came back to God and His church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian system of government , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study reveals that when people report messages reported neg@@ atively about Muslims , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims rose up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear fills us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assignment of collective debt is not only about having to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was start@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a sav@@ vy young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , has murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who visited the afternoon .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we went sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and went out of my shoes , and went into the hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the I@@ mam required an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had drawn courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble Denk@@ fabrik , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am as usual as it is allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any regard .
if people like an exception tend to appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a milli@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air p@@ acts penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . a few years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting flights , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build up self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to laws of nature .
today we want to show you a few of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to autonom@@ ously work , it needs to know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an editor of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pseud@@ om@@ u@@ gi@@ l c@@ f. p@@ ask@@ ai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red ne@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Biot@@ op einrichten &quot; &quot; &quot;
a flight machine that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has big advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often question basic abstract questions that are at the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled air@@ planes , which had only two moving parts : a propeller and a rear ru@@ d@@ der .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ ar , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote servi@@ ce@@ able aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ d@@ der , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens so much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . in order to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it correctly .
the probability of throwing it exactly right when I see all is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ ar is an exercise in fru@@ gal , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cope with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the most au@@ sp@@ icious ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some models are available in models , the rest is learned directly at flying .
let &apos;s look at this .
if flight machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ propeller aircraft engines .
this turns clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance boost .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will demonstrate this by making half of the air@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration examines the synthetic heat .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we accepted standard micro @-@ Quad@@ copter -- every single weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to re@@ think of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine over there would like to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us the wage is in development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ y cir@@ cled each other more and more quickly , so they turned the mass of three sun@@ bathing in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
this short moment they gle@@ amed bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in the first time .
1.3 billion years ago , it was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group particularly Mu@@ tiger -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser det@@ ector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized her as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was considerably increased , which improved the detection rate enorm@@ ously .
that is why we call it Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detection of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes penet@@ rated through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than that :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well from my death @-@ sick father .
basically it was the fruits of my work .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and her through observ@@ atories such as Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ru@@ ff@@ ling in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses of rel@@ ativity often lead to a correctly al@@ ber@@ ed dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and di@@ gest@@ ed by the sur@@ ge of the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . this is why the Lig@@ o employees declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser det@@ ector , and this is absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nucle@@ us of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
THOR@@ NE released this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because in this way you can create an image or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points .
in tones this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
the face of your child is about .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as tone and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just said Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can reveal much about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ps simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same p@@ aces with an additional key change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement @-@ vo@@ cabulary , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget , Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ a sound &#93; somebody who knows what he has to hear is recognis@@ ing this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold Sun mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s take a look at what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 Suns , circles around a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this consists of the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to study the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the space and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not to see .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ole stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes are happening at the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through since these are opaque .
the Big Bang : I &apos;d love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by his own offspring .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run of things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o they observe , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you are dre@@ aming with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I feared for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do when I was afraid , removed my fear .
my fear of speaking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valu@@ ables &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need milk for my be@@ ak terrace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I s@@ wore to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I just do or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that &quot; yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things out , bring you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce TV .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three TV programs , at the same time four , 16 epis@@ odes : 24 epis@@ odes : grey &apos;s , 21 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my TV series are running on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I &apos;ve created myself , and not just produced , so still ob@@ end@@ rein . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who does it ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work so you understand that I am not just around the computer and fant@@ asi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming in a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
it is , as I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so as if you dream of a high sound , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliver a marathon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and disturb@@ ing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the tot@@ als sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it .
many people accept when I declare to them the tot@@ als that I am persu@@ ading that writing makes me happy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it .
but the tot@@ als -- when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the Sum@@ ma is more than writing .
the tot@@ als are action and activity . the tot@@ als are a drug .
the Sum@@ ma is music . the tot@@ als are light and air .
the Sum@@ ma is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , you cannot aim differently than to size .
the feeling that you can &apos;t be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ ma .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is gen@@ ie .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more epis@@ odes , the more epis@@ odes , the more there are more epis@@ odes , the more work there , the more work there , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the Sum@@ ma , the Sum@@ ma , the Sum@@ ma .
I like this sum . I love the tot@@ als .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the tot@@ als stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the Sum@@ ma stopped .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single job .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ anen .
they are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als ceased .
the tot@@ als of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was out of it .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my sum@@ me was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same tit@@ anen @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ days , w@@ rought weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium ab@@ uses not , give up with whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ ted heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an Show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sum and the tot@@ als I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; present yourself , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you are working , you love to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves another and that gives one the sum , when you know the sums , if you already knew the sums , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say No , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valu@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valu@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I hate it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz wor@@ ries , and here all changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes without letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; lets go .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I am breathing .
playing is the opposite of working .
and I am happy .
something in me tri@@ ggers .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not right away , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the tot@@ als are slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the Sum@@ ma , but a Sum@@ ma .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the tot@@ als , the amount of work , the title surrounding , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the tot@@ als are not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
real sums depend on love .
the tot@@ als are the current that comes from the lust of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
real tot@@ als ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be imposed , expectation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any blame .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , if I want to hear the tot@@ als again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t have to play as much as they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , for what kind of person does he prefer to be like home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we race around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I &apos;m always ready for my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe are filled with me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with playing ?
you can also say it ! always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ aming .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and talking to my teen@@ ie daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need .
everyone can get 15 minutes per piece , even on a bad day &apos;s day !
15 minutes per sli@@ ce !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my oasis of well @-@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it is necessary to feel the Sum@@ ma , have a place for his peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and preserve it yourself .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan at training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes at the track , why not indul@@ ge in full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the tot@@ als came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melo@@ dy , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum@@ ming is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that is my sum@@ ming .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the tot@@ als of work is part of me , but just one part . and for that I am so grateful .
it &apos;s s@@ no@@ wing to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who is playing a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires burn still .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the tot@@ als . the land I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the Sum@@ ma , the Sum@@ ma , the other , the correct Sum@@ ma : the Sum@@ ma of Life .
the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , captiv@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more me !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after an accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the best known ones , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in the process , one is im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the switching circles of the neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson which suffered from severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma sw@@ ells the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save life , one has to reduce skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that was exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells which can transform into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die ; they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split up slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they stem from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear , however , -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then they highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the sampling rate of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vit@@ ro , in culture .
here , of course , we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take for@@ age p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
when they reached a stable level of velocity , we injured the motor motor sector in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , it spont@@ ane@@ ously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plasti@@ ci@@ zed brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , as well as with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand side you see the monkey that spont@@ ane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill approximately two kilo@@ grams of papers and forms to undergo this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can enter the hospital and that therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
first , you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy . it is a democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as self @-@ evident .
we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable Being .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved dou@@ bt@@ less that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe .
beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was declared un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as Finance Minister in the Euro@@ group -- the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not the austerity programs that were realised in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends that repeatedly told me that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are being wast@@ ed , our future glo@@ omy and wast@@ ing our great new technologies .
on the issue of wast@@ ing I would like to point out an interesting obj@@ ection that is currently threatening our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin Summit Par@@ adox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the denberg who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the denberg ,
but few realize his twin .
a mountain of unt@@ apped cash , which belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations , who are too anx@@ ious to invest it there , where it would be productive and bring income to produce the debt , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past three months , 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars were invested in the US , England and the Eurozone , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.2 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing to infl@@ ame the stock exchanges and apply the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops that are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is job@@ less stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , and , consequently , a low overall economic demand , which as in a continuous loop supports the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , as in a continuous loop , promote the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , that could be true that his son would kill him when he grows up ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally causes the circumstances that lead him to k@@ ills him .
this is my v@@ ague with capitalism --
his extremely wast@@ eful Article All that un@@ productive capital should be employed to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , aliens , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ish democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons .
the decision @-@ making of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is , that it imposed the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting weight in questions of state interests .
the ath@@ en@@ ish democracy has not kept a long time --
like a candle lit very bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , our liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ish democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ word for rulers .
the liberal democracy only emerged as a complete separation of politics and economy possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our democr@@ acies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this division of politics and economy began , as the economy gradually under@@ goes politics and dis@@ ma@@ zes them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not about de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in the government nowadays and yet not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my v@@ om@@ iting with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated that it is star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has can@@ ni@@ b@@ alis@@ es politics so far that it goes through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality falls , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ian left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ acon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wages through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the tw@@ ins peaks higher , the waste generated , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- very soon as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
so we have to re @-@ create the economy and re@@ unite the fields of business and politics , and we make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines are used to serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to indul@@ ge in the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what do you need , how could it look like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the section of the company : ask a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one place to the next , and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and rede@@ em , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no differentiation between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work therein , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong there . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please conc@@ ede that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of each country into a mutual fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment resources are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that you did not have the technical means at that time .
today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ t@@ arian in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ anism , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ anism .
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno ban@@ ani PRO@@ MET@@ H@@ EU@@ S Hip @-@ Short
you write yourself in your biography yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said this . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speaker explained very clearly what you consider from the view of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the area of economics -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a certain sense , if I can say it as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
now , to pret@@ end China to do what the West has done in the ninet@@ eenth century , it sm@@ ells immense in hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start with the euro@@ zone a new beginning ,
not only Greece but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is to say good@@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the sustained den@@ ial that a massive exploitation line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first suggestion to reveal this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to sust@@ ain an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , one might delay it for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has not made any mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course , I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that went through the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that for 5 years they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika of the financi@@ ers who imposed this policy were : &quot; it was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the fre@@ ed forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have disast@@ rous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to suggest the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be also int@@ ol@@ erable for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we sincer@@ ely hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most have never heard , although he is likely responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy did three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon@@ ography and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible to choose the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought sector .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the review distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this review .
if your show is rated nine and higher , it is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive to where , after having watched a relay , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to for@@ bid &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average ul@@ cer , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not exc@@ use .
so he has to make sure that he is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s also the first time that Amazon makes something so , therefore Roy Price wants nothing to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon releases things in vain , do you access right ?
millions of viewers watch these epis@@ odes .
however , they do not know they are observed when watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you jump over and look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this turn is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so just above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to figure out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they embar@@ ked on a risk and decided not to make a Sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this turn . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data accomplished companies .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work in everything .
when one colle@@ cts millions of data , for a decision you hit then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized with a very powerful computer .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary , because we live in a time in which we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always produces the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data most accomplished companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could predi@@ ct data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the worse way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was a sensation once more , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life - at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use lots of data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized several patterns of the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so you can analyze the items ; as a second , set the items together to create a resolution .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool for that and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to be put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been capable of . but the decision how to put all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then chosen as &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the tool for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to work with a technique demo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays out to make decisions , be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
