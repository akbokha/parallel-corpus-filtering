<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times journalist.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he released spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA delivered literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years the government has determined against cracks and urged him to call his alleged sources." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblower to condemn and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen thus lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had years of indication that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government on cracks were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can be hidden less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and cracking, that could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his permission, have secretly been secretly worried,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit future, and even Reisenachweise with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and tears.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which did not exist yet, as Risen had written his book, and it is much more secure than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet acclaimed Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news web site, like those of the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot secretly procure information, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology denominators like Edward Snowden have a possibility to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals. or the next environment worker who suggests alarm to contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street-Insider that warns us ahead of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leck of history was published.] [the Panama Papers "reveal that rich and suspicious] [we bade Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous enterprise. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release, and on the next uncovered documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a Agententhrillers or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that concern us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians will discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and obscure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I imagine it always like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle that these control oases function, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, you need less information to give less information to form a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to dock especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 attorneys in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked that everyone except a lawyer made suggestions to our investigators how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was handed over to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer, who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigators." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through which corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very trivial as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen suggestions towards more transparency concerning the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has recorded in central registers at national level, who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress that we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind projectors.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this type of transparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the intransparency, which now enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazet.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. after that he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Look, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get there?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, slept on toe tips to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs up today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Being on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it, to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I wondered how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such "air mattresses and breakfast" [Airbed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people can post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still at consolation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have learned all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are referring to the things you can do. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone from your left sitting neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who now actually has Al Gore's mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell Twitter that he is channelled to the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have introduced himself once with his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgments that say: "he can really hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-through feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative judgments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had left their judgments before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are about age and habitation.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three appraisals, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation satisfies similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get away from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "as for example," "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your home! I am doing vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dissolve these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly: a need not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million spent nights only had a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonderful things can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who are inclined to heart attacks because of sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay is going on.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled on this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing accumulate with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a commercial trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it's just now just" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves openly, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, this is to be compared to Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you have visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub winding neighborhood of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if one could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul this project has already begun. many parking spaces owned by the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were moved out. incubators were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was even a kind of hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"" "" "" "I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drive past me." ""</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great impact, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people don't speak with their competitors.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe-fitness-fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to carry the Hijab to carry my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air pacts penetrated into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to autonomously work, it needs to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an editor of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>

<seg id="422">A flight machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and thus has big advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often question basic abstract questions that are at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled airplanes, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospar, the mechanically simplest remote serviceable aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens so much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. in order to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it exactly right when I see all is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospar is an exercise in frugal, this machine is here, the Omnicope with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the most auspicious ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some models are available in models, the rest is learned directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flight machines are to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance boost.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">"" "" "" "we will demonstrate this by making half of the airworthy." ""</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines the synthetic heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted standard micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, these demonstrations motivate you to rethink of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine over there would like to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wage is in development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far distant galaxy circled each other more and more quickly, so they turned the mass of three sunbathing in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they gleamed brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in the first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, it was just a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group particularly Mutiger -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized her as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- gravitational-wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was considerably increased, which improved the detection rate enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why we call it Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was started for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes penetrated through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than that:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically it was the fruits of my work.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and her through observatories such as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ruffling in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses of relativity often lead to a correctly albered dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and digested by the surge of the waves. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. this is why the Ligo employees declared crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of a nucleus of a nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">THORNE released this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because in this way you can create an image or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as tone and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just said Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravitation can reveal much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirps simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same paces with an additional key change. this sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement-vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget, Ligo heard the following: [Surrena sound] somebody who knows what he has to hear is recognising this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold Sun mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's take a look at what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 Suns, circles around a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This consists of the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to study the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserole stars explode in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes are happening at the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through since these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I'd love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by his own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo they observe, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You are dreaming with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "yes!" "" "that I feared for." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do when I was afraid, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of speaking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life, to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "valuables" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "I need milk for my beak terrace." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on I swore to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I just do or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that "yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things out, bring you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">"" "" "" "the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars." ""</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three TV programs, at the same time four, 16 episodes: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I've created myself, and not just produced, so still obendrein. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think, when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I'm talking about work so you understand that I am not just around the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that it's not about dreaming in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, as I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"" "" "" "so as if you dream of a high sound," "" "deliver a marathon." ""</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the totals sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the totals that I am persuading that writing makes me happy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totals -- when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The Summa is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totals are action and activity. the totals are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Summa is music. the totals are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summa is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, you cannot aim differently than to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that you can't be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more there are more episodes, the more work there, the more work there, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the Summa, the Summa, the Summa.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The Summa stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single job.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "guess I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titanen.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The totals of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was out of it.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totals did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My summe was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same titanen-work, 15 hours-days, wrought weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium abuses not, give up with wholehearted heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an Show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the totals I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "present yourself, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you are working, you love to be a teacher, a banker, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves another and that gives one the sum, when you know the sums, if you already knew the sums, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern" "" "waitress asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mama, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say No, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "valuation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one more" "" "valuation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I am Titan and my buzz worries, and here all changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of summing, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it goes without letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" lets go.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am breathing.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of working.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me triggers.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not right away, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The totals are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the Summa, but a Summa.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totals, the amount of work, the title surrounding, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totals are not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totals are the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real totals ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be imposed, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any blame.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, if I want to hear the totals again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't have to play as much as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, for what kind of person does he prefer to be like home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We race around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I'm always ready for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe are filled with me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naïve for a daydreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking to my teenie daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes per piece, even on a bad day's day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per slice!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. it is not necessary to be the children. it is necessary to feel the Summa, have a place for his peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totals came back in my free time. the buzz seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the summing is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is my summing.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The totals of work is part of me, but just one part. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing to me that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who is playing a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my bonfires burn still.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>

<seg id="786">The more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, captivating, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more me!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am the author. I think things out, I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means living his dream.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after an accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the best known ones, the "deep brain stimulation." in the process, one is implanted a electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the switching circles of the neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that skull-brain trauma swells the brain and increases the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to reduce skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove some swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That was exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology that stem cells are unripe cells which can transform into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split up slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They stem from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then they highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the sampling rate of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dyed in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here, of course, we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take forage pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of velocity, we injured the motor motor sector in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">The monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, it spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plasticized brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, as well as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand side you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to undergo this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can enter the hospital and that therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy. it is a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable Being.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved doubtless that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact democracy vanishes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">Beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was declared unequivocally clear to me as Finance Minister in the Eurogroup -- the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not the austerity programs that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends that repeatedly told me that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are being wasted, our future gloomy and wasting our great new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the issue of wasting I would like to point out an interesting objection that is currently threatening our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin Summit Paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the denberg who throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the denberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few realize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of untapped cash, which belongs to the wealthy economists and corporations, who are too anxious to invest it there, where it would be productive and bring income to produce the debt, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past three months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US, England and the Eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.2 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did nothing to inflame the stock exchanges and apply the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin-tops that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is jobless stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, and, consequently, a low overall economic demand, which as in a continuous loop supports the pessimism of investors, who, as in a continuous loop, promote the pessimism of investors, that could be true that his son would kill him when he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances that lead him to kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my vague with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely wasteful Article All that unproductive capital should be employed to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, aliens, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the athenish democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision-making of the Athenian democracy was and is, that it imposed the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voting weight in questions of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenish democracy has not kept a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle lit very brightly, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenish democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a byword for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy only emerged as a complete separation of politics and economy possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time when this division of politics and economy began, as the economy gradually undergoes politics and dismazes them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because you can be in the government nowadays and yet not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my vomiting with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, which sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, decimated that it is starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has cannibalises politics so far that it goes through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, the inequality falls, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twins peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the deacon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle, without creating new species of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wages through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twins peaks higher, the waste generated, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- very soon as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to re-create the economy and reunite the fields of business and politics, and we make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film "matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia similar to that in "matrix," in which machines are used to serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "so what do you need, how could it look like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of the "" "" matrix "" "" similar dystopia? "" "</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the section of the company: ask a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one place to the next, and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and redeem, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work therein, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong there. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please concede that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "the cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "Kosmos" "" "-- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of each country into a mutual fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment resources are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that you did not have the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time libertarian in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesianism, global keynesianism.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno banani PROMETHEUS Hip-Short</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography yourself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely confused.</seg>

<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I can say it as provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now, to pretend China to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, it smells immense in hypocrisy.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most have never heard, although he is likely responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy did three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an iconography and describes on Twitter as" "" "films, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible to choose the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the review distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad," "" "Game of Thrones," "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows that are addictive to where, after having watched a relay, your brain asks:" "" "where are more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows how" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average ulcer, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not excuse.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's also the first time that Amazon makes something so, therefore Roy Price wants nothing to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight Candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon releases things in vain, do you access right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you jump over and look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so just above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to figure out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they embarked on a risk and decided not to make a Sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this turn. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data accomplished companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When one collects millions of data, for a decision you hit then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work, then this is a bit scary, because we live in a time in which we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always produces the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data most accomplished companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could predict data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the worse way -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was a sensation once more, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life - at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use lots of data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized several patterns of the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components so you can analyze the items; as a second, set the items together to create a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for that and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to be put together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been capable of. but the decision how to put all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then chosen as "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data" "" "say to us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the tool for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">"" "" "" "I'm going to work with a technique demo" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays out to make decisions, be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
