Munich in 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich fav@@ ours exciting stories .
it is anno@@ ying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
that knows everyone who had to be up@@ set because the car @-@ Nav@@ i rather showed a green me@@ adow instead of a circum@@ stance road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very reve@@ aling .
especially when comparing them with current online @-@ cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one cannot recognize as such .
in the large picture postcard , detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blätter , were incorporated in cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and origin@@ ate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9th February 18@@ 01 : it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bayern @-@ card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ele@@ ctor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian sur@@ vey@@ ing administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the map was created , so 1877 , as a Munich district .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ mor@@ dial @-@ up &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots present no farmers there today - but small farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ place of the October festival , was actually a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s District , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or at the height of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse one once locked people with mad@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gud@@ den led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , related to the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time , and for example ended the bet@@ ting of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Z@@ si@@ ren Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s biggest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now meeting in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
West is the football field of the T@@ SV München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren facility , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Place &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once at Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn stem was carried out .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich @-@ card with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publish@@ es travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for the Promotion of Far@@ es issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i on the basis of discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force until August 28 , 2017 , promp@@ ts af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based inci@@ dents occur lat@@ ely throughout the country and can be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , which disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately target@@ ing minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue travel warning , said NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have infr@@ in@@ gements of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the voy@@ age , and was taken into custo@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Bureau of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be held 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to make che@@ wing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime amend@@ ment program of the F@@ BI who ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations at the 16th rank of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) had issued war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws , ob@@ lige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing according to the AC@@ LU .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lat@@ ely interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue next year .
the C@@ DU President Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have gained a picture on the spot .
in the legal grab@@ bing of the Schwen@@ demann family representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ man C@@ DU local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
at first Markus Schwen@@ demann granted insight into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black water milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative market for the milk of its cows , such as Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the holiday guests only regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the BL@@ HV chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot operate on such steep surfaces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot of things must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if it did not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often under review due to the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 via the electric fence .
the area of disclosure is thus 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the population was promoted by leaders , a quarter bore the community of Fischer@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not do a good job without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conserv@@ ation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state promotion of electric f@@ ences .
the goal is to hold the Black Forest .
prerequis@@ ites are the presence of a subsi@@ dy named by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the enclosed area must not be tra@@ pper@@ able ( slope over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation .
the proposal of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence for the 2018 fish farm project in 2018 .
the area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump ré@@ g@@ ime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in an heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposal by the President for the dr@@ astic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but it interven@@ ed , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller amo@@ ung A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem which you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the touching words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your arms , / your oppressed masses who cra@@ ve to breathe free , the mis@@ erable rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural con@@ frontation : it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical figur@@ ative depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo@@ conservative , who brings the American flame into the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is said to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ usive but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump want to ever recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two ball@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Director of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championships &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black thinks that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to figure it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type of street corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally introduced were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete at its fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ d@@ les , says it &apos;s &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir carries on this road and has placed five British and two European records last year .
it will participate at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world champion@@ ships as the only other Scot@@ sman at the Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be mixed with medals and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to the podium .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking critics via Facebook : do not apply for a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the consent of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to its political principles .
he cri@@ es in criticism , surely .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an , who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked and er@@ ased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ ended it at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dism@@ is@@ sed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type of Hog@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary he@@ at@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , blocking persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars are unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Mim@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people who wi@@ eld the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a past@@ or , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled Catholic faith to Ho@@ gans .
At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled with water , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take up the same topic , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor described as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical disgu@@ ises and to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but just this is happening digit@@ ally .
Hog@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question came to Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County missed the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ LU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers embar@@ ked on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions which critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ ae@@ field left up to the final round before being lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rapha@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job as he established this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we always cher@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to his homeland .
this event will be its first Scottish gig since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer pul@@ mon@@ ary canc@@ ers due to passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died for passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are due to passive smoking , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ ingen street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie more reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze , head of the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off gates is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , it does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai government in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the carbon@@ ized bulb is extracted and swal@@ lowed with free@@ zing , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were assigned no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which subordin@@ ates control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or lawyers .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua , the independent part of Pap@@ ua Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19,@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs that were converted by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright robe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaf@@ lets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst chil@@ dless and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has depos@@ ited gold and copper in the value of USD 3.1 billion .
Pap@@ ua also has wooden resources valued at € 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ vian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprison@@ ed by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ul@@ atory high@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1970 @-@ er years have become genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bec@@ ome Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ b@@ ane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal supp@@ ression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the most popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ anese War@@ ming cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants began to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved into the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mo@@ m @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - tast@@ ed their market . &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jo@@ ko@@ wi , promised to tackle the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has little changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jo@@ ko@@ wi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai had only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ wis inaugur@@ ation a low point in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of eleven children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a cl@@ ash on their tone and later returned to four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and struck the group with their rif@@ le bombs , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Commander to demand justice .
they carried away cerem@@ onial hunting b@@ ushes and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - continuously and im@@ it@@ ating a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to hur@@ ry stones at police and military posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an official document not released by the local media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans bears a name , the TIME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Spe@@ aker of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ gar@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news of the kill@@ ings came up only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jo@@ ko@@ wi in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto testi@@ fied in October 2016 that he submitted an extra@@ judicial mechanism to the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto opened a retreat when he talked to TIME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he did not plan to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is governed by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , whom the UN has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; claiming more than 1,000 deaths in Eastern Europe &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses have already been included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alle@@ g@@ ations with fier@@ ce dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired at vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others died , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus , Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we &apos;re afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on to hold the officers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officers to account and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a susp@@ ect for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the indigenous Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army claiming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by pushing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custo@@ dy under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive up again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is also out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ ary and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of the sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between native Pap@@ ua and new migrants have grown , which have been in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ ire Airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own businesses competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
beyond that , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ champ were de@@ ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ ko@@ wis suff@@ ice to raise the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report Indonesia &apos;s troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa extension and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely limited to the immediate neigh@@ bors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence on May 4 , indigenous people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but Pap@@ ua will probably not be able to vote for Jo@@ ko@@ wi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ko@@ wi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Chief Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jo@@ ko@@ wi to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , see their voice for Jo@@ ko@@ wi as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ers carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried in a terrain precisely against the police and the military station .
they know they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with her head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fire cap@@ tures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tor@@ ch &apos;@@ Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ r@@ atz@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Dubai for the second time &quot; &quot; &quot;
a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire , which is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units broke the fire at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about security of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 resulted in the greatest part of the damage caused by cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police told them that the system of boards for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died .
keine Davis @-@ Cup @-@ Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has enjoyed his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the one for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two sets of competition was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ pack classics remain intact to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our membership has not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
at all , not until the vote , after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal has already come before the final decision to leave the final at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host &apos;s right in the first round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , etc . and players will have to complete less official media meetings before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items into the aircraft , find a survey
a survey conducted by passengers found that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously prohibited items passing by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally worn out cut@@ ters or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they would late discovered that they were mistakenly powered with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travelers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have kno@@ w@@ ingly worn objects with blades through security control while 2.2 percent of female sur@@ vey@@ ed and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately forbidden drugs into the air@@ plane .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers had brought about the airport safety and how many would have done it inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry the safety , those who fly most often .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids can carry them with or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of items conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la &apos;s customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give up with the huge number of orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has hi@@ ther@@ to under@@ cut that a part of the clients has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ y figures on revenue increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time revealed a different , less lu@@ str@@ ous figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often adverti@@ sed with the more than 500@@ ,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery has just started .
now , Mus@@ k is one : from the total of 5@@ 18,@@ 000 orders , 63@@ .000 have already been with@@ drawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and the United Kingdom 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; Reservation payment . &quot;
at present , 45@@ 5,000 such un@@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
last year Tes@@ la supplied 84@@ .000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 bookings per day .
who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production lines without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater delays , the obligation of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in flo@@ cks .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt is reti@@ ring due to the hes@@ it@@ ating of the rules of Obama &apos;s Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be respon@@ sive to the needs of the state environmental authorities to respond faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the claim which was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that took place on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for O@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt declared in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or imp@@ eding economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was president of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , was a long time a reliable opponent of stri@@ c@@ ter environmental protection legislation .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations for the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA manager has crossed its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet dead@@ lines for implementation and then to be accused of being accused by activ@@ ist groups and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said that the EPA claimed more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take time seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority which we give us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the New York Public Prosec@@ utor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York Attrac@@ tions California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smoke can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered at P@@ ru@@ ff &apos;s surprising exchange of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturb@@ ing how much pressure it takes to preserve this sensible step by the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government to turn to environmental poll@@ ut@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche the old cemetery are@@ al is invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius @-@ plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the Six@@ th Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tum@@ ours their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini stres@@ ses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique little jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ kunden@@ buch ( Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ kunden@@ buch ) : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church at Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard from Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , the former parish church , besides the former parish church , was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or pat@@ ron@@ age was right and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as emerg@@ es from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ our , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the most beautiful settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the privilege of pat@@ ron@@ age came from the early medieval self @-@ kir@@ chen@@ right .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , retired and occupied with a past@@ or remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
in doing so , the right to use a past@@ or or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two tram@@ pled on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly acquired bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later during World War II it had to be handed out in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) windows were in@@ filtr@@ ated and the bell tower was stolen .
the roof was le@@ ak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were located near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ arius @-@ Cem@@ etery was also the last resting place for the dead from hearing schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm divided the bell tower and the half r@@ ushed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was canc@@ eled .
only the still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em take care of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius @-@ plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organis@@ er , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ nen invite on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is made by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler gymn@@ asi@@ um Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the name of the village Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3.30 pm .
for the so@@ unding of the ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers get out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius factory , which is of importance for tum@@ mies and hearing schwei@@ ler .
the friends and suppor@@ ter tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to home care , such as ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to be approved by Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ dern
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim does not work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not look any legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ hrt sich &quot; sum@@ mon@@ ed Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( C@@ DU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is done un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind power plants could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining city area .
such zones are meant to prevent a &quot; reduction &quot; of the landscape .
a few days ago , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind energy concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette due to a change in the area of land use - but the district government in Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a form@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council once again determined the wind@@ break zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; an approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out legally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing has been made in circles since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle is taking them to test the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday wanted not to express itself to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ hrt sich &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was involved indirectly , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ axle households .
the NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council made green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ ush together : woman dies with terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wen@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in a fatal accident .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police indications , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch moved to Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and tra@@ der planning &quot; Home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ zen and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September .
the business association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to downtown shopping .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the city &apos;s own city pe@@ eled away from the usual supermarket product .
there is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center should invite to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehensi@@ bility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend , so Christian König .
municipal administration and business association co@@ operates with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the business association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the well @-@ organised Sunday , talks with all the trades and hosts to actively participate in active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the reno@@ un@@ cement of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be re @-@ opened again or again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city while shopping .
at the end , all would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - right up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it learned to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broad@@ ly made , King had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the HK Centre in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ home &quot; day , the first five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities , took part in the first time .
beside Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adverti@@ se the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment with his buying behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
in a gas explosion in Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy .
on Wednesday ( local time ) the fire brig@@ ade was still a viol@@ in@@ ist in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was also found dead later .
in the case of the dead , they were employees of the school .
as a result , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .
during the holiday period there were only a few people in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
tr@@ ump consisted of tran@@ scri@@ bed tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump demanded in a telephone call with Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president ple@@ d@@ ged him because he publicly den@@ oun@@ ced the wall . according to report he said to him : &quot; you cannot say this to the press . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to allow Mexico to pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an ex@@ iled exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States who immig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would let him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moore Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with guns to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man of middle aged in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside frigh@@ tened the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es burst the silence , when a young black man was drag@@ ged by the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a follow @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience suff@@ ers very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were gel@@ ded by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ concei@@ vable that no single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil right .
for him , the position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that injus@@ tice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a du@@ vet on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding county coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but nobody has ever been indi@@ cted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on free feet for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made possible for the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote during the summer election campaign .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to data of the F@@ BI the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they went away from the prison and approached Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des an F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspir@@ acy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in kill@@ ings , removing evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more memorable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election campaign massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra has led the annual im@@ position of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descrip@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism from which many believe that it no longer exists in America .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and f@@ ake as Gre@@ ene started a well coordinated view of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the chief cl@@ an member for years , but he said the role never becomes easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ester cri@@ es and aff@@ licted him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona leaves the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gig@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors swe@@ at@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and just there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a mour@@ ning dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays s@@ adly pra@@ ising &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street .
they have experienced near Georgi@@ as for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks carries her on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial places of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels g@@ ho@@ stly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the ly@@ re name .
children squ@@ at on their heads , record the f@@ ake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the ly@@ n@@ ching rope away and wi@@ pe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embrac@@ ed two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat down with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple ch@@ ats from Atlanta about the post @-@ position with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski struggling to find words , which feeling the performance left .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like yourself and do what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called only police fir@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in a way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wagner @-@ ians in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) either shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ tö@@ chter pos@@ ses as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked barrels of oil remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; stage .
the three Rhein@@ tö@@ chter - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonder@@ fully .

brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
the audience thanks the ensemble with a powerful appl@@ ause .
stor@@ m@@ ically celebrated by Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bled himself and de@@ pl@@ ored the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors had been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
when he had to leave a gell@@ ar concert in 2013 , there were five years later great jubil@@ ations in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner should be pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its perception .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work at several locations in their volunte@@ ering year .
where to go anywhere ?
crowd : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture fair , once a week I help in the furniture bridge in Greven .
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I made ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realized for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , I probably do a social worker training in Jugen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places to use during the Vol@@ unte@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you make your FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ care .
for me it was just the right thing that prov@@ oked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
you always have other people in front of you , who each have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee whether a teen@@ ager was born out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the divi@@ dend in order to revi@@ ve the business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
in addition to its previous restructuring , the job reduction , the general director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , has already lost 4,000 points .
in May Pear@@ son announced a plan to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ( 39@@ 4 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after the first half of the year saw an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ vo@@ i attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , sharing a declaration of NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence in Afghanistan that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops deployed the Taliban in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to delay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le after complaints around
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of Obama &apos;s government , which states that states are obliged to reduce the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states accused the Agency for the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Policy 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it is showing the commitment of the Agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and to respond to our governmental partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to specify the O@@ zone regulations in which poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stri@@ c@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental challenges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is supposed to stimulate economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the disman@@ tling of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups , wor@@ rying about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants community space &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ zeln p@@ auses the establishment of a community space in the future retirement community .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing piece of land was signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although the church community is still owned by the church , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the municipal council we@@ aves to view such a common room not as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ iors of sen@@ iors , but openly in the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , is made by means of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a community space would be , so T@@ j@@ aden reported , with 60 percent of 30 percent condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the resolution fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this regard , one does not want to throw any ni@@ pp@@ le between the legs , the finding that both sem@@ it@@ ra@@ iler - what is le@@ aning on the ambient temperature - as well as mono @-@ roof - which reduces cutting height and makes the construction more economical - could be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wilfried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the board .
it &apos;s not that easy in the communal room .
Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings , with which one can &apos;t get along very well , but now you can rest in the common room of the window , she says , &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger really speaks for the communal space - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area , there is no subsi@@ dy , but a real , in case of doubt market@@ able counter@@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ iger &apos;s motion to cut the proposed resolution accordingly finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , two counter@@ parts remain with the original programme , which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
colli@@ sion by car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto the road
when crossing the road a 82 @-@ year cycli@@ st on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and badly injured .
as the police said , Langen@@ felder &apos;s 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder was on the road with his bike on the bike path of the Black Way from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Langen@@ felder drove to the road , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met with a car who was steering a 66 @-@ year @-@ old help .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with a ret@@ tu@@ gn@@ ette .
FC Bayern München needs to do without Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup is taking place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the match against Dortmund .
with human resources , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory event of the new season .
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the winner of the cup .
in front of the super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the German soccer @-@ record champ@@ ions Bayern Munich are getting bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to reno@@ un@@ ce David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans into their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 people , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the Harz Mountains
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz Mountains the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is planning the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ war@@ te Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; desc@@ ends to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ besu@@ cher , whose name was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the site .
accessibility is also a crit@@ erion .
later the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad Ticket is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ base , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the single stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star more light than another , although it cle@@ ver@@ ly further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ m@@ eda Galaxy have to be seen clearly with naked eye .
since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to planned star@@ bases - planetary path@@ way .
beginning in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory , as well as an &quot; alien &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of tracks ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with each planet - including the P@@ lu@@ to at the end point degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned accurately in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a ball of 6.5 mm diameter , while the sun measuring exactly 75 metres is measured 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to P@@ lu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fix@@ ation would take half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a colli@@ sion course in order to stage the most exciting competition in the near future among 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council light weight champion , down the cor@@ ridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super fe@@ ather@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday on Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put forth his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect mag@@ nit@@ ude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move to lightweight boards &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko will fight with a 135 pound de@@ bu@@ ts this year to schedule a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell according to their lightweight title match in the forum on September 23rd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later op@@ ted openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he likes Lom@@ ach@@ enko as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday @-@ fighting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko believed in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Drei@@ kampf Champion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from River@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus is to show impact , then boxes .
both said that they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire space
in case of an accident on the A7 , four people were severely injured in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the exit of the market , presum@@ ably after a tire he placed control of his vehicle .
the truck slo@@ wed to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ took and then stood on the roof in the green stripes .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then traffic on the left side of the road was passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette funktioniert besser &quot;
after 2 : 2 Andre Hoffmann hopes for the start of the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result even if there were not the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two ad@@ vers@@ aries too much , and we have to go better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf &apos;s defense player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the Drei@@ erk@@ ette should also be further optimized .
and a gate after an impulse would not catch the For@@ tun@@ en any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ day chain than with the four @-@ day chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Because we have just in the tr@@ ench on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ elmann people who can build well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t make so many ab@@ norm@@ alities in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about an accident of a failure , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand at four points on Sunday and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judge the start of the season after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the play of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a favor in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior Minister of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland are considered to be a light favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so spar@@ kle wants to experience his players in no case on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um App@@ el@@ ance Tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started carrying out the tests last year .
they should make the assessment of age more exact during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Department ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for fail@@ ures in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees , which were minor years .
until today , migration verk@@ et 6,@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the person &apos;s age is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results have been steady over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are quite consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; propose that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she stated that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in the x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans , to see if they were going sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
jud@@ ging biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it certainly , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is in@@ accurate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proce@@ eding well .
on Wednesday a seven ton of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Head of Building and Transport in the District Court of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work began at the same time on all three need@@ y bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge consisting of concrete , which is coated with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges run across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge board .
this is a boundary fix@@ ation , which is also used as an operating system .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metres wide bridge board is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way will proceed .
the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridges .
special finger tips have the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cr@@ abs had to be f@@ ished at first .
for bridges between the building yard and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties tend to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is hard to put under a hat .
the Parties ( C@@ DU , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows peaceful flag on this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle invites R@@ ond@@ elle to the lou@@ dly poster &quot; great election pr@@ el@@ ude . &quot;
and famous names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the parliamentary election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D dealers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and therefore right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him with him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel , he dedicated himself to such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us cher@@ ries there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 8 pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ person Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch stop their spe@@ eches .
the police presence remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 9 pm .
the police can shift - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
in the series Has@@ lach &apos;s con@@ vent concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche , a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ tromb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet player Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan fol@@ klore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European leading orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ oth@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play become a fascinating art work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core of the programme was first performed with huge success in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter tears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette present@@ er assured the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I &apos;ve been fil@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
according to her separation , Kri@@ sten said that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show biz &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in school time when they preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , they don &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some consider me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify ourselves before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from doing so to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , convincing message , &quot; said R@@ NC chair@@ person R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be absorbed again into the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chief Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were shot away in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ADA ) had found evidence of state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e Repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships , which start on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said re@@ por@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ itu@@ ary for Mali &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crashed soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a fun@@ eral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have been thinking about a helicop@@ ter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral under high safety precau@@ tions .
to an unprecedented fall , Minister of Defense Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( C@@ DU ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two inver@@ ted drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ön@@ ner of their discipline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifices they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann out of Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the German Ar@@ med Forces in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the fun@@ eral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( C@@ DU ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ eker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grapes laid down ro@@ ses ; their relatives were arm in arm in the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ s and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense from Ley@@ en called the in@@ dig@@ nant soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ anger had built up the flight operation of the tiger helicop@@ ter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of its reg@@ iment .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to whom the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , no one would have liked it . &quot;
doubt about the UN mission in Mali was not demonstrated by the Ley@@ en : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are ref@@ unded , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prinz Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prinz Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this shared the roy@@ alty on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the Queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued to write in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a meal from it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also lays down the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ma@@ hl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not have the title and function he wanted , he did not regard himself as equivalent to his wife - neither after death , explained L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief spokes@@ person of the Danish roy@@ alty .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will be ultimately un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew away , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy state in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk we@@ ave instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
C@@ DU and F@@ DP in front of potential majority in Lower Saxony
Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is following the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but does not want to res@@ ign .
he said on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the parliament .
prior to that , the surprisingly res@@ ign@@ ation of a Green Party from its parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hanover lost its kno@@ b A @-@ votes @-@ majority in parliament to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
the previous Green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen combined its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the C@@ DU &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ DU @-@ Fra@@ ktion@@ sh@@ ef Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend his Group to take up her .
thus , C@@ DU and F@@ DP would have together 69 seats in the lower Sax@@ onian parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled for the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the Parliament decides as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ DU faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Prime Minister pul@@ ls trust and el@@ ects a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options need to be checked properly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all issues in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ v@@ est &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as an app@@ end@@ age of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens demanded the dism@@ iss@@ al MEPs to return their parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that she has received her Land@@ tag@@ sm@@ and@@ at , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to make any language pron@@ unci@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the tak@@ eover of the Lower Saxony MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen on the C@@ DU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the S &amp; D Group on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Parliament .
the exit T@@ v@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their van@@ ity and fru@@ stration are their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary @-@ General Hubertus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that C@@ DU is involved in this dirty trick @-@ play in Lower Saxony and tries to propose political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s C@@ DU @-@ Fra@@ ktion@@ sh@@ ef Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend his MP to record El@@ ke T@@ westen in the C@@ DU .
the SPD faction of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 election with personal care@@ ers .
at that time , the C@@ DU was the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens at the time before the SPD , but a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament day .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about si@@ ze@@ able eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal have happened ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect the eggs from poison@@ ed eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Consumer Protection Portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all that we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically ruled out .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ n@@ aissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless my house has immediately stopped and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has the same responsibility as the manufacturers to bear in mind that the sold products are capable of traffic and health harm@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at eggs the resi@@ due @-@ level content of 0.00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the enterprises are to blame .
are factories and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production companies do not have immediate gu@@ ilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies , they must reck@@ on with economic damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there is too little contro@@ l@@ ure in the case of an appointment .
is it lacking only on the staff or even on the concl@@ usive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent .
precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be found are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are right in@@ dig@@ nant .
the arm@@ oured means are manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact becomes swi@@ ft and completely enligh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football affect Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ imp@@ eded issues of European football clubs will not inter@@ fere with Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s &apos;s World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that it must point out some@@ time that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar signs and brings him to a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team through the wealthy family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter with legitimate income sources that allow them the break even point in their business related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P setting , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in dis@@ grace from the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are away from excessive expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the redemption sum for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players , instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ look their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market records , the UEF@@ A would not count this as legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PSG @-@ payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Qatar about payments from the organizational committee of the 2006 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PSG and Qatar have argued that Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become a World Ambassador and would simply be easy to figure out such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PSG about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that , in 2015 / 16 , a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million generated a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PSG believes Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival is a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing Deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s departure by claiming that PSG would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PSG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finan@@ ces a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financi@@ ally Fair@@ play because one has different paths or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sch@@ og@@ gi@@ fer supplier
in the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Frey has made Frey @-@ Chocolate for the Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is at the end of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ speaking erin Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Frey , &quot; said the spokes@@ person .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaging boards of 14 grams are distributed each year before landing on the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss will not give any information about the costs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achiev@@ es an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what &apos;s more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a g@@ og@@ ging producer .
the Swiss will not want to reveal how many applicants are given the new ten@@ dering process .
however , only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Frey seeks to make an effort to rene@@ w the treaty over spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
the Swiss has been distribut@@ ing chocolate plates on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Bar@@ ry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility of placing the logo led Swiss to the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Frey two and a half years ago .
the airline collabor@@ ates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long hau@@ l flights , the customers of First Class with goo@@ dies are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class wet passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi von Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is also distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Frey , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the 80 &apos;s characters , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter hit the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels as if time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a promising tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ ff@@ ing herself to the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle aged played hor@@ ny children , who are grown up - still managed to win the last part of the joke .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who are playing adults now , is less emotional and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the found@@ ry principle , among them a reef on the stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; Die Hand , die die Wie@@ ge schau@@ k@@ elt &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character cl@@ ashes through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now novel@@ ist novel@@ ist , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ evil plot in which Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) is involved who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ on &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random mad@@ ness that could he@@ el this fran@@ chise like a recur@@ ring &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang , how it will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now remin@@ is@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon levels are synchron@@ ized in English .
it is an in@@ gen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - creates a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer carrying a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
in six long epis@@ odes it moves there , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; who was edited on a lower length could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men dev@@ our@@ ing a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary Communist audience is that western culture can do everything for the for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have succeeded in a blow to the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and have already issued warran@@ ts of arrest against them .
in addition , the officials ensured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same time , two persons were arrested in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German warran@@ ts .
the two will probably be shipped to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
a total of more than 300 police officers were in use .
the ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organized crime crime , heavy violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
in the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office established Con@@ stance against the organized drug trade in the southern German area .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the large effort on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehensi@@ bility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise lam@@ ents big gaps in the aliens @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ rul@@ ings in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the register of foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis conducted by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality are listed in the Register , among them 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by some 600 For@@ eig@@ ners in Germany .
because the data has not been adequ@@ ately maintained , data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from 1921 were found in individual cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can slow back processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on foreigners there are exc@@ esses EU citizens who have not had to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false regulations led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun to return to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Osn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in paper it is said that BA@@ MF carries out such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - from Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy delivered guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) ref@@ uses to accept these commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU states would send refugees back there as part of the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic spokes@@ person on the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights ab@@ ound conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second @-@ best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations now distributed 50 liters of blood .
traditionally , the church in the Municipal Council meeting hon@@ ours the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is created for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who provide their blood for stran@@ gers , still un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Mayor Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the round@@ about head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn makers reported from the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 sp@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected later to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month since the weak economic growth weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the domestic income would continue , whereby the inflation in autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the coming years interest increases would be needed to cho@@ p the inflation rate heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected at the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic package which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the next February , although it was said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to suffer from consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets await .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ mentally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Investig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news versus the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 Euro .
no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth will likely be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the latest issue of inflation offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and low wages , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing gets worse first before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to recover until the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused sin@@ king of the sound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will come back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said that the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attri@@ but@@ able to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ ague , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are negoti@@ ated and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closing , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a high court fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis taken before the sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of risk of high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the news announced on Thursday was greeted by N@@ HS England @-@ chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to permit registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection haz@@ ards .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a GP can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchasing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges facing mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if targeted towards need@@ y and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
in September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Sh@@ adows of Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delayed and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this li@@ fel@@ ong infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , crashed in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without losing ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous room the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable ch@@ icks are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you push the door very easily gli@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that touch you and thus help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical so@@ ckets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square meters of something standard@@ ly in something completely aston@@ ish@@ ingly .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ n@@ asty , in a con@@ frontation over one of the largest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ frontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood since 1973 .
there , the West@@ co Jeans family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b .
according to an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; described in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record states that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of property and cash has turned out to be a point of issue for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opinions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed attempts .
the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - from what Col@@ in , as Paul claims he has ruled him out .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance says that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports by companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and lawyers held by both parties .
Mrs De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen business from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ laden of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other Brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group , where Col@@ in claims that marks were paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has with@@ held himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ umps new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the President &apos;s Media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ por@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information in the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media di@@ ät .
President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election function@@ aries there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ umps Twitter habit has ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about others - that Tr@@ umps twe@@ ets would have included even more ignition without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his co @-@ workers managed to keep anger from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented it from causing tr@@ ump contamination .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - entirely occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to lead the President for strategic reasons without question@@ able information .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump as a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts to find out where they origin@@ ate from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has sold false accus@@ ations in the past and has re@@ vo@@ iced her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these in@@ variable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after crimin@@ als receive mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population is wor@@ shipped and hoped for .
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als during this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the heavy crimin@@ als are not known , references from the population are gathered and asked to pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the campaign which follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ ets hide themselves at vacation destinations , called it by Euro@@ pol .
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
the website ww@@ w@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ .dll since 2016 has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online spec@@ s have been captured so far , at least eleven of them due to references after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate about a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; milli@@ on@@ aires &apos; series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some un@@ locked travelers on the foot of war , who have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn by the community to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans in a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the def@@ ensive units and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back again .
more came to the evening yesterday , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local taxes if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be named said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of this trav@@ eller just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person by the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on land beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by invo@@ king 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create an image of the situation in which the court must check when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aus Birk@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Luise
the Wald@@ hotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened again on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and also revenue from the city tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatic increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rat@@ samt as a collective accommodation , which caused contro@@ vers@@ y discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Council of the Council .
but especially Freuden@@ stadt lord mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and talked about serious potential buyers in the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Luise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Luise and now Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the former Birk@@ enhof facility has been standing in front of the entrance since a long period of time and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations will be made .
the floors were pulled out , blank@@ ets partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room belong to the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , she@@ ar stres@@ ses .
the Wald@@ hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wanted to set up wide , explained Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted discussions with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
looking for the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly .
under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior plants are also brought forward , that is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is open to public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ äre : us @-@ Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler sets out Grand Jury
in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee in recent weeks recorded the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to persons familiar with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper ad the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ c@@ aster reported that there are already initial inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services have been bl@@ aming the Krem@@ lin for a longer time to pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ing in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examines if there were agreements between Tr@@ umps election team and Moscow .
the focus of the investigations is to stand for several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign .
report@@ edly Mu@@ eller took more and more Tr@@ umps priv@@ ates and business environments under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote that the Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler Tr@@ ump personally moved to the centre and investigate whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in possible break@@ down@@ s and decide whether it is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called with counts of indictment .
mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the process is always carried out behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to re@@ charge persons for the det@@ en@@ ment under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps were also advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former campaign head chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the meeting .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the enforcement show that Mu@@ eller does not shy away in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up at the end to decide on the indi@@ ct@@ ment of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President made a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affairs as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his Special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he does not know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
but this work is usually in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that not against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has no reason to assume that something has changed because of this , it was stated in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this pro@@ clam@@ ation , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump were no@@ isy , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him about setting up the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President is under great pressure for the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and its staff .
the solved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theore@@ tically rests on the pres@@ idency of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft bill on Thursday , after which the special educ@@ ator could no longer be dism@@ is@@ sed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ eberg dri@@ fts in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tica a gigantic ic@@ eberg has been solved by the scar@@ c@@ ely seven @-@ times size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ haven Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
over a tril@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss is now driving to the north and probably will need two , three years until it has mel@@ ted .
it is one of the largest ice gig@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres .
there is no danger to people from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear after research data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual quar@@ ant@@ ine frac@@ tures in the region for around 30 years , writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor behind .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms at the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this f@@ estiv@@ ity the balance of w@@ axes and break@@ age was dis@@ rupted a few years ago .
a complete ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ file is there , A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate is under sus@@ pen@@ se and can fall apart if a piece is broken down at a key point .
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the glacier leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can drain directly into the sea and can flow more quickly than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in low measurements , the British research project writes about the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest scar@@ let of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the open ocean approximately 200 metres .
there it breaks on a regular basis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow or fall back over the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these scientists do not lead to the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , many king@@ fish@@ ers of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have been crum@@ bling over the past few decades .
this long tip of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to the research programme of the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
in the last 50 years the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula war@@ med up around three degrees and thus counted among the areas in which the temperature was at the fastest .
C@@ DU wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the C@@ DU calls on the employer association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the circle of Krei@@ sel gained 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
there are now 17 tra@@ inees their first day of work .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 620 applications were to be recorded for the places that were in vain for this year .
nevertheless , the circle still l@@ acks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehensi@@ bility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the C@@ DU wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the short@@ age of skilled workers in the administration .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehensi@@ bility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term demand for qualified staff , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate short@@ age .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ career and include an education offensive , call for C@@ DU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees who leave illness or age depends on the service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , president of the C@@ DU , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he had long been sor@@ row@@ ful in the working day for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel expenses cover and start@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come short @-@ term to a satis@@ factory solution , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the affiliated towns - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the C@@ DU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases or more money exist only if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least because of the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team effectively collabor@@ ated with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express detailed alle@@ g@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all alle@@ g@@ ations which are currently being raised , after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had super@@ vised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , which has been monitoring since October .
it is thought that its crew adop@@ ts infl@@ atable migrants who are delivered directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can go down so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was alleged to be only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of taking away the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police officer who super@@ vis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign is Nobel Prize winner organisation Do@@ ctors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharp@@ ly in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun seeing light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine hamlet bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy sights and attractions .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led with hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ desheim .
viewing points followed , partly on towers , of which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream planes .
in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again , v@@ antage point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and hu@@ ts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed sal@@ tw@@ ater in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neustadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 al@@ timet@@ ers , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for e @-@ sport
are the sport stars in the future sit in front of computer con@@ soles , instead of being we@@ ather@@ ed in wind and weather over the stadium ras@@ ps ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have also recognized the first federal lig@@ aments that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg started in 2015 , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to inspire whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger , CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there will be a number of ship@@ pers on this move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , FIFA World Federation organized FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified .
Robin D@@ utt , too , sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will go into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the attempts to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you could be seen online much more often on these markets than to send the Federal Government to Asia only once a year .
what is it exactly ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level .
for a long time , like in normal sport , le@@ agues have established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian games 2022 E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a kind of sport at all ?
for many , the idea is certainly custom@@ ary .
Ingo FRO@@ B@@ Ö@@ SE too has been dealing with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is a competitive and a lot of biological and physical responses that can be found in the classic sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but FRO@@ B@@ Ö@@ SE also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sport were missing .
the scientist empha@@ sizes the high Integr@@ ative Eff@@ ect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
a study by the consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predi@@ cts rapid growth .

Michelle Carter on the texts that Conrad Roy urge to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced to Conrad Roy in June for the negli@@ gent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her advoc@@ ate argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was sentenced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have taken Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she totally regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Jud@@ ge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he didn &apos;t find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t get the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry with us forever , for his sisters , &quot; it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ acked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the knowledge that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be a aunt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in one vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text announ@@ cements that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang@@ s yourself , spring from a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is turn the generator into place and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced to Italy in 2007 because of murder of her British ro@@ omm@@ ate , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was able to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern Wa@@ its for the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - Extra motivation does not harm .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he took the ha@@ sten@@ ed binding on his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Kap@@ itän . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the condition could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach was able to interpret Kim@@ i too .
not the eight @-@ year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had been selected from youth players , de@@ bu@@ sters and just out of their holidays , but he .
the sweet@@ est of sugar is distributed to those with a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in mood .
those who were chosen to compete in Lah@@ m &apos;s heritage can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed as a mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
to the right side , this is his position , the white binding on the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i was working on this grid formation like the one who can take the helm at the best .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ en@@ acted tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal with it to over@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly til@@ ted ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , come out to the services of the Asia journey ( folded also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le are not neg@@ atively imp@@ acting in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .

Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ ulated sover@@ eign@@ ly .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition Sü@@ le tried to win a few times in the game structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y stated that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he too showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how unusual this Bayern @-@ Welt is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw after the game .
for example Rud@@ y was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs but also six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ acked statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ singer Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes to prepare the construction law until 2021 .
the country &apos;s plans also play a role in the plans of the country , which is in the pen@@ etr@@ able need for the federal transport schedule .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Cornelia Hol@@ tmann , minist@@ erial spokes@@ person .
of course , nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) aims to promote a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label , like Wis@@ sing , to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to found their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incen@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the completed master examination and 2500 euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after master training .
the home@@ work schedule for the country stays long .
with the planned road construction , facts are quickly to be created , at the same time there are no necessary personnel for the country , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , CEO of the I@@ HK Trier .
from 56 new engineers who want to set Wis@@ sing at the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility , 29 jobs have been occupied until now .
the Chamber calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
C@@ DU @-@ FRA@@ K@@ TION@@ S@@ VI@@ ZE Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the court , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country as it wants to solve the short@@ age of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ timi@@ dating is the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ating internet connections and break@@ down@@ s .
on the other hand , former economic minister Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out of politics and is still sitting on the super@@ visory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months they already cleared the field because of dis@@ agreements .
Audi should change 8@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in over 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ it diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install systems to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles is also increasing what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is also accused of p@@ anning the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but at normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was det@@ ained in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system in order to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes propor@@ tionally to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ wer@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o used to be one of the most common carto@@ on carto@@ on carto@@ on carto@@ on carto@@ on carto@@ on characters .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ini@@ er still records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : Lau@@ ghter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he found himself among other things as a drawer for fortune @-@ playing cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
time and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , rounded Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his threatening figures continue to spread worldwide .
he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dic@@ less popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .
la@@ ven@@ der in Provence threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions remin@@ is@@ cent of d@@ rought conditions and because of diseases committed to diseases , leading scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert at the Agri@@ cultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has an effect on the lif@@ esp@@ an of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ cal@@ ves , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ hren with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drugs wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leaving them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ r@@ ale , allies .
they ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and belly feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the sal@@ aries of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while in the whole country the bodies are pil@@ ing up , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hanging on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a prob@@ ation@@ ary At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 , in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the kill@@ ings associated with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they are still insi@@ sting on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ent and even though the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we susp@@ end everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are struggling here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drugs kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was to not force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ por@@ ters loved to publish hard accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce it received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever she was leading .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you consider as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ? why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and coun@@ sels , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine be his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their women , their children , their clean stores , their secret starting and run@@ ways to move drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anno@@ y@@ ance is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happens to J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , no cell phones were allowed . days before it became known that spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce runs on three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of brother of former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state spending that concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group staying in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kid@@ n@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or as it happened so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ por@@ ter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the ruling institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated the entire century all political layers .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this area , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months earlier , the readers had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we would have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office became a storage room for characters and sti@@ ckers , prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ por@@ ters Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
in the whole country journalists became lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on side@@ ways and buildings .
on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez charged the authorities to spy on journalists and to leave them because they have said the truth .
she has since asked her to be re@@ classified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and a uni@@ form@@ ly society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were infected with organised crime under a blank@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media fan group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern boundary state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am for my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were located next to their detached head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Laredo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ elle with a editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug traff@@ icking was frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum up .
a series of shooting stars with ri@@ val ri@@ val and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the on@@ board edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ten up close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the immense portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day , when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern@@ s asked me to send them to the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers found that the first findings of the unbelievable r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ ation of a Canadian mining company were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sli@@ pp@@ ly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the periodi@@ cal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the per@@ ished din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well preserved condition has aston@@ ished researchers , which describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he du@@ g in the Sun@@ cor mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy Erd@@ kl@@ ump@@ ens .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rier . &quot;
researchers found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ser , although covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by flesh @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shield technique that is known as a counter @-@ coating which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now visible at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ ading is usual , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r of sufficient pressure was hun@@ ted by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the deteri@@ oration of con@@ frontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the chal@@ k season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ mak@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died , fell into a river and was driven into the sea where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as Southern Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far more inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served ch@@ apped skin , but also maintained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only do a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , that were standing on two legs , perme@@ ated the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried in the sea after death and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he du@@ g in the Sun@@ cor mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the whis@@ per@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
on average , the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pound ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es was floo@@ ded by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater book preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the fossi@@ ls of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin fi@@ sts still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ er@@ long st@@ alls - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , around 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first indications of the police there were at 5 : 00 between the junction boxes Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm approximately 30 vehicles , among them probably lor@@ ries , inter@@ locking .
there are no indications of the exact number of the injured .
it was light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large blo@@ wer of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of the Munich trip there was a ten kilomet@@ re long set@@ back .
as a AZ re@@ por@@ ter reports , it also occurred on the counter@@ act to massive han@@ di@@ caps - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade noted the characteristic signs of the vehicle t@@ ank@@ ers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ish@@ ments .
shortly after 6@@ pm there was a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a colli@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a helicop@@ ter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and just have an in@@ gen@@ ious thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or rei@@ mb@@ ur@@ izes the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
delivery time : 1 @-@ 2 days *
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the managed ticket control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that one takes its place and thus evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; the train calls the de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
you must also have bought it via the app of the rail@@ road , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation then appears .
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is located on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train companion at the ticket control room at place Y he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valued online ticket .
so you can sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ti@@ cker control through our train companion personnel , simply check yourself in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables the passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB remote marketing manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often run trains know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tions are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often you have yourself , but in any case one of the participants does not need all the documents you need to de@@ valu@@ ate online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate .
the result is endless discussions between train companion and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the bot@@ t@@ oms or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ os@@ e@@ worthy streams ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her core .
only one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly prayed on her tim@@ eline .
the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed , black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ et live .
he posted a picture of Bro@@ wns &apos;s blank body that was stretched on the street and remained there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone to go back later in the evening to Twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of police and people crying , and a man claiming to be Bro@@ wns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sha@@ kes .
I was angry and we@@ eping . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she picked her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as starting at 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand responses .
when Fer@@ rell and her daughter , who wore a cau@@ li@@ flower and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked about the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I have the chance to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black female child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel that I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp territory , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take on Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after August 9 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ eram@@ an Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve heard that people born and grown in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not cent@@ ered their voices and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt in@@ mates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his engagement brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns &apos;s shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks to us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are presented , for this is how I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim was not to focus on Ferr@@ agu@@ el &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she falls in love and marri@@ es her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that this work and the de@@ human@@ ization of black people have to give a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who , after the killing of the black teen@@ ager , Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women need to bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person sho@@ ok up that energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the foref@@ ront because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news stations in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the r@@ acial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on for three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ ms &quot; : TV @-@ readers will discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping m@@ all at the south end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation of 2009 split the population into pro@@ ponents and opponents .
the subject can hardly be cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while those say to the Bit @-@ Galerie : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size car ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , from which the rest of the shops profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ eds .
in addition : the gallery is planned on the plot on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work it will end .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher wishes to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone rooms : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been buying nearly weekly in the farming market for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are very happy again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there are also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery , pay attention to the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but probably the new project should not be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why Shopping M@@ ust in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is well @-@ priced .
as you can see , stores are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies , as the rentals there are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , there is almost no more and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmer market hall supposed to be during construction ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery will actually come .
or does the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit @-@ gallery already manage to sell all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that stands empty does not need anybody .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - no more point@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the center of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which almost resem@@ ble the cables hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where former sec@@ rec@@ y analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after she publicly disclosed the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website as a secret secret .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and a pione@@ ering dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by M@@ anning and made from 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , a sharp , although somewhat intellectual comment is not only created for the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her picture was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white self @-@ ie in which M@@ anning is obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of foreigners from for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigar@@ ette bl@@ ouse and che@@ wing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visit her at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so contact Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were turned into un@@ equal brid@@ les which during the course of two years inter@@ changed several letters .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the president Chel@@ ub &apos;s verdi@@ ct would convert and it would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand was a welcome type of happy coinci@@ dence .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little low and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery called M@@ anning with her superior signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name has been marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ eck Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is one side from the above mentioned comic no@@ vels .
it shows M@@ anning , how it emerg@@ es with a free @-@ talk phone in the hands of the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they dress up your speech , then they won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was fores@@ een in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the space by the mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ical simul@@ ac@@ ons , which assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic Hap@@ sal groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prof@@ ess@@ orship of the University of North@@ western and an employee at Oxford University for kill@@ ings
a nation@@ wide human ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been stab@@ bed with deadly injuries .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as reported by Cook County &apos;s official court .
the documents say Corn@@ ell Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several engra@@ vings died .
a common warning system , published by the Chicago police authority , states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ icals , the Vice @-@ President for University relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been rated to leave the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal act examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every imagin@@ able way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to be himself .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them rein@@ force themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip that said that in apartment 100@@ 8 something happened .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team at Grand Plaza has published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the W@@ ADA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ADA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ ADA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ ADA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the Rest@@ ore of Rus@@ ada and was recently published on the website of the Organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ADA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian At@@ tor@@ ney General Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 Rus@@ ada was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia during the dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als of the W@@ ADA .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July , W@@ ADA general director Olivier Nig@@ gli announced that Rus@@ ada &quot; moves in the right direction &quot; in order to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is best to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to en@@ qu@@ ire surveys , offer special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , to provide employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers manage to b@@ yp@@ ass the C @-@ Suite leaders and direct themselves to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tool is used by companies to measure employee engagement .
saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124;
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ Poll@@ s and Poll@@ s of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low appro@@ vals - so that you can demand , why .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former colleague has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the &quot; Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments &quot; technical website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behaviour , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
recently , u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behaviour .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints directly go to the super@@ visory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has seized regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,@@ 000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified swi@@ ft@@ ly identified and addressed , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair tra@@ ine@@ - .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology for monitoring ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured a $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more jobs from their work@@ places than before .
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assign@@ ments in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
the staff want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ sive and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the third party analy@@ tics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if change is not fast enough or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 inquiries , you will have to be ready to have 4,000 calls , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have left too much for collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employees surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bon@@ ding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A remo@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their Tri@@ kot@@ express parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled to the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already accomplished timet@@ ables of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the bro@@ ws postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as &apos;s six seasons in West@@ wood &apos;s practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of formal preparations for their start @-@ up against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the rules of change in the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the multi@@ fac@@ eted routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply push it through , they plac@@ ick themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been disc@@ ar@@ ded with foot@@ balls , which will have a protective net behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task .
bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fac@@ tual review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit messages to third parties and show their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to Fak@@ ten@@ ecker , which may display results of the invoice audit from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many believe that they have also influenced US presidential elections 2016 .
the problem is also a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French vot@@ ers were floo@@ ded in May with false stories in the run @-@ up of the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to quickly remove hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that a test of the new facts will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories are challenged in third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ er years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in Be@@ wl River valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ anna May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emoti@@ onally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire burned due to the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he is also there .
ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) this is all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that centuries spent in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape officers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only granted full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ o@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that portra@@ y who had something : &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families .
guys , let everything go their way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to divide on a broader basis into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of an uprising that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps they are connected to each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit painter , who hid the Dar@@ rell family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the 18th century sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell , who filled his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a gri@@ t , always making debt and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ mines . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for other unique typ@@ ing experiences
he had a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle envel@@ op@@ ed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the contrac@@ tion of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secre@@ tly by Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August it is said to be the highlight of the campaign a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the Action have been asking for the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Kapelle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her un@@ ob@@ sol@@ ete website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the action it is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is imper@@ ative to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally she is competing with other commun@@ es .
a mid @-@ five @-@ figure amount can be added to the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year in early August , Ankara has consul@@ ted the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) on retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
this is how this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the head of the head of the government , the five vice @-@ ministers and the ministers of defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs took part in the consult@@ ations .
in this way , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the surplus .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the officers of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were removed .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as a leader of the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 486 people who have been involved directly in the attempted coup attempt , Ankara has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the General Staff there is concerns about increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest@@ ed itself in the lifting of the head@@ ache b@@ anning for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Groß@@ rein@@ em@@ achen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the army and the security forces goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan for@@ warded further 73@@ 95 officials , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they filed their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan re@@ pressed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt from fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned the Turkish army to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that happens , such development could not leave N@@ ato cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance for pur@@ ge in the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stri@@ c@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restriction for family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries have Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ ate track for Renn@@ stei@@ shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les has been fought over and over - now it is said to be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist train is going to be built .
in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction works will start in the course of this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country ackno@@ wle@@ dges this mainly for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the track increased to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , is currently approved , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ ing@@ ia train as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be ordered in regular order on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in recent months , a pilot operation has been tested whether the distance is used by enough people to order them again in the future .
the track is also heavily b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that it can &apos;t be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are a big thing at the moment .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking up their asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern sl@@ ums have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes more disturb@@ ing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would allow a step@@ ford woman to look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o Doll@@ s have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , who gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturb@@ ing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape if one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , troubled the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy war@@ ns with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point out to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R recogni@@ zes their increasing popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the edge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ aks out of the edge zones can be very in@@ structive with regard to the mind of the time in which we live .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time in which the rights of women are threatened by the world in which there is a president in the White House who bo@@ asted to have attacked women sex@@ ually .
the most horri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the eyes of the eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that points to independence or anything that could bo@@ ther the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are frau@@ dul@@ ent slaves .
or to express it in the style of speech by 2017 : maid
sl@@ umps of great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of life
it has become a re@@ assurance of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized US vot@@ ers , have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving Festival , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all rig@@ or@@ ously rigid to let our filter bub@@ bles burst .
less had been noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ looking poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she had fought for decades of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is related to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the decre@@ asing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to shift all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and Tr@@ ump we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens no longer meet us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself today of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ kom@@ ic version of mad@@ ness falling - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return was out ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump seem to appear as very mild off@@ ense .
if tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
as my c@@ ousin in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ Administration , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are cris@@ p and the animals twi@@ sted to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ishing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Them@@ e Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
but Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as here two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40@@ s can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to rep@@ el the valu@@ ation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to slo@@ wing what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ used , while I got tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 when he shot them through a door of the toilet cub@@ icle at his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a ni@@ ghtly in@@ truder that hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is too sigh@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Investig@@ ation Administration said that it would raise obj@@ ection at the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the quad@@ ran@@ gers from F@@ ützen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the vac@@ ations and in the secondary schools .
three of the students go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , the director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of the dism@@ iss@@ al of school , the 29 students of the four classes were elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , a young eagle that grows in the ch@@ ick@@ ens yard , but then fre@@ ed into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ um@@ ar Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler im Hüh@@ ner@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his ch@@ ick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken hat@@ ch a little eagle came out .
but the hope to make a chicken out of him sm@@ ote himself , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylin@@ ders bore to the bet .
the Eagle stands for the integration , said School director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ year @-@ old that he feels accepted in his new school .
a word of thanks to the colleagues was followed by the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always j@@ umps on teaching pas@@ sports , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the kitchen time is over now , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she only rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly leaves lessons very hard , because it was a really great time .
finally , they were able to rely on the four @-@ t@@ v@@ asses .
finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ time for@@ esters are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprison@@ ed for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
in the morning of August 1 , in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illeg@@ ally celebrated people was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released the same day as an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have shar@@ pen@@ ed control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial money pen@@ alties .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine penalty .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group have offered software updates for around 5,@@ 3 million cars in total .
they should improve the emission performance of cars from emission categories Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE Auto Club Europa gives ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the software updates that are tra@@ ded are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates are only valid for vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit has ordered the Swiss Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but not yet an exact date .
Daimler inform@@ s about writing any affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the framework .
how long will the upgra@@ des go up altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the app@@ endi@@ ces from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we have seen , the autom@@ akers are not acting on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming can be to get an appointment .
what are drivers that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a threat to a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first r@@ apper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and participate in the awar@@ ding together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series has therefore already announced to ab@@ stain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump in order to make clear their views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will enter retirement next year .
the site is already written out - however , suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker has been Mayor of Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him a lot of fun , as he teaches in the press conference .
he reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , he wonders that until now , no application fulfil@@ s the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or a building engineer at the next time .
so - considering the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a preparation .
since Has@@ lach works as a subordin@@ ate civil authority for the Administr@@ ative community , the applicant has to submit appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would it no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to drive to Off@@ enburg until Off@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but close proximity to the city and it is important to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have gathered to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ arrangement of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ als and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz around are app@@ ended .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renov@@ ations are still subject .
only the latter will be be@@ ech with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available for a city builder with great clearance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener , many people can react flexi@@ bly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what pur@@ ses , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city builder emphas@@ ises .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for the past ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for the past 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , according to information of the city of Has@@ lach you should instru@@ ct a completed academic degree as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with professional direction architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of building ord@@ n@@ ing- and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt supports civil and civil engineering , building guidelines , gra@@ ding facilities , municipal property management , municipal farm with building yard and urban gar@@ dener , as well as under civil rights authorities , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : Süd@@ bahn@@ str closed
according to the police the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway line crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and look for them since night hours .
close to the crime scene there were witnessed a sco@@ oter of sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ zz realm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors would have put themselves in great danger themselves and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the transport .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the system as well as the delayed drive and the cost of rail replacement transport , P@@ ön@@ alen of railway customers could also come to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; altogether , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum should be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be led without disabilities .
almost ten personal trains were held in Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freight trains failed , but they had late . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells capable of dis@@ solving inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
experiments have been observed that a kind of tolerance condu@@ cts immune cells in mice occurs , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium required tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an is more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel movements , if the same system also s@@ wir@@ ls in people .
the post@@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes the tolerance , when it found out that a group of academic mice had such cells , but another group of the same stem , which had been kept separately , had not had this .
it presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the dam@@ pers of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice lacking .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they l@@ acked an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they obtained the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism , known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ Lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the for@@ age of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an have been found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. crosses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ field player on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound sign of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday and impressed in the Mo@@ unting role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho de@@ vised his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho demanded three more new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations .
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew away from Seattle in Washington State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD chief , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked after elections with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no fires from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the elec@@ tive fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were heart@@ beats .
and one after another .
after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal government C@@ DU sees a general signal against coalition co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said C@@ DU Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Green Party dep@@ u@@ ties the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months prior to the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director , Michael Kell@@ ner , urged the low @-@ hear@@ ted Lower Saxony MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the C@@ DU means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ toral plan .
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and Ele@@ ction Camp@@ aig@@ n of the Gre@@ ens to the German Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD election war@@ rior sigh@@ s when the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands there , after the tak@@ eover of the green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen on the C@@ DU without its own government majority .
it is the pro@@ visional climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the case - and everything became much worse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te breath@@ ed the party smoothly .
the comrades were te@@ di@@ ous again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was coming from Hamburg .
and with him came the next heart@@ beat .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD LON@@ DE@@ SCH@@ EF , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did pretty much wrong in crisis communication then what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has fought for political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW exhau@@ sts and its role in the super@@ visory board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in cri@@ tique for quite some time now .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to put emphasis on acc@@ ents in recent weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained hidden , too , in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l at the party @-@ internal pressures of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens is fundamentally no fault .
and Schulz did not even know .
meanwhile the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the seclu@@ ded parliament@@ ar@@ ier@@ in T@@ westen .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Mrs. T@@ westen presents her own career interests above the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Party Left in the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , the Legal Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ westen is not elected for her person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony @-@ Green Party in parliament , so the Lower Saxony Chamber further .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the election of vot@@ ers four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower @-@ Saxon SPD as a candidate in the parliamentary election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future C@@ DU dep@@ u@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or it has been further commitments of the C@@ DU Niedersachsen .
Förder@@ gel@@ der für Orts@@ kern III ( German only )
those who want to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated in the years can soon get assistance from the country .
furthermore , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of STE@@ G Urban Development informed on Wednesday in sensi@@ tivities .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 it has been implic@@ ated in sensi@@ tis@@ ation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler current renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development and not only develop new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the 4th of April , the Information received from the government of Karlsruhe that there will be a reconstruction area III .
the amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 euros would come from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ v .
how does a rehabilitation area emerge ?
one will continue to investigate , so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned territory .
if necessary , the area limits could then also be postpon@@ ed again .
the STE@@ G represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations were then carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is per property , carried out .
the san@@ itation area would eventually be established as a by@@ laws .
the grant period for funding runs since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out once again , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionn@@ aire for filling out .
in November or December , it is expected to take place as soon as possible in order to start with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every Commun@@ e must carry out the said pre @-@ ab investigations .
it is a question of evalu@@ ating and deciding the conditions of urban@@ ization , and to determine when will be remedi@@ ed and to what extent .
for the respective plot , there will be a re@@ mark in the Land Registry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will even come back to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a key factor for success for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it is concerned , among other things , the structural condition and remedi@@ ation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hous@@ ehold and Housing Bo@@ w &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled when operating in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - who comes first , grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reser@@ ving &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Orts@@ kern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refur@@ bish@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military provided to the TIME magazine , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th at the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 countries .
the helicop@@ ter built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued alongside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the Chron@@ icle of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicop@@ ter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his super@@ visor , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived in the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
the original air@@ plane was during the event at the helicop@@ ter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
the records provided by the TIME were not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event may hurt the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we imagined was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you were shut , &quot; the deputy commander answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and wouldn &apos;t be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for reform of the reform of health reform , which was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to ins@@ ulate government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy spokes@@ person of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently carry training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 exercise land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ter units also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; Non @-@ Pres@@ idential Dec@@ is@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not participated in putting the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not store bud@@ get@@ ary records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , however , the Do@@ D refund policy for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicop@@ ter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates involve personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 R@@ AND study , the rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of the helicop@@ ter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the federal state Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to empha@@ size that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicop@@ ter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
&quot; &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; runner of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga k@@ icks off at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ lit Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the TC Blau @-@ Weiss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Blue @-@ Weiss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ lit Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite after five games still more fla@@ w@@ less record , the leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga made sense for reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay in any case has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , imports from the high north are mainly concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
currently , at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella actively Fr@@ ench@@ man does not lead to the Bundes@@ liga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) is the first in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday playing with the White Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the Ball .
he was supposed to be like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niels Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two vict@@ ories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team .
enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World rank@@ ings in January 2016 , does not fill anyone from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ res .
how America can harm O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not appear when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast to en@@ force the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Congress wrapped up a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US offensive .
after all , the draft seems to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the threat of dro@@ pping is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the corporation could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer un@@ vei@@ ls , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over for a long time .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state hol@@ dings and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) comm@@ its the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bit@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back@@ wards : the city places 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens , the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the town of K@@ ref@@ eld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bo@@ iled will continue except home : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh Gek@@ o@@ chtes cooled .
the city operates 46 day@@ care centres in the K@@ ref@@ eld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time .
there are 28@@ 00 children sitting at the tables last year , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for by 45 weekly hours , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita zu Mittag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time workers have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give away the meal , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as sevent@@ y units - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for kit@@ ers to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the ch@@ ick @-@ power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by a special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that they found themselves in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign enc@@ ore for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , Director of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ elled in the coun@@ cils in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban issued threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international fighting meetings to a consult@@ ative role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year elections for the first time will be handed over to power peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elect@@ oral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of registered 3.6 million vot@@ ers are registered .

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union would like to make sure of the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glas@@ gow with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which in addition to other products , hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; concerns to express that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow urg@@ ently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person at Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with staff members and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all the companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the Barcelona warn of Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not fail in its pursu@@ it of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after receiving an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release cl@@ ause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record collapse ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the previous season for 89 million pounds .
after completion Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way to the outside although a source near the Catal@@ an Executive Board insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PSG @-@ president in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City took interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club wanting to sign one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona appears to have crossed this line , with the Spanish society at the beginning of this summer &apos;s interest in the mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report about the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eved Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provides further discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he acquired from former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bischof and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would greatly serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about his own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the events at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the violations in Regensburg no one doubt that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also princ@@ ess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and that &apos;s a dev@@ our@@ ing food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ ws had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , how I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who dealt with R@@ atz@@ inger the mem@@ or@@ and@@ um &quot; Mein Bruder der Papst &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report presented by the German lawyer Ulrich Weber in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 547 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , the fact that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
especially in the case of high emoti@@ on@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other alle@@ g@@ ations , many victims ass@@ aul@@ ted the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories relate to it despite violence . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal was reli@@ eved at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence by force of prot@@ est@@ ants at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradi@@ ctory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tan@@ gible for the o@@ int@@ ner when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musi@@ cally did not produce top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs in it at all .
just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity in complic@@ ity in complic@@ ity in sexual abuse .
also the ty@@ ran@@ ny of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside of his sphere of influence .
at best , one can pre@@ ach him to learn about it too late or not take first indications seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which he appeared , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the broad majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also represents an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always cared for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by children &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional emoti@@ on@@ ality , which has also led to out@@ bur@@ sts .
that he did not only kne@@ el with chairs and threw the key on the ground , but also for@@ gave ear @-@ cerem@@ onies and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself has given himself years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the ty@@ ran@@ ci@@ on eating at the pre @-@ school , this is ad@@ mitt@@ edly Bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed to him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger published in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a person who was affected by the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in a professional manner .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a sought after student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that out of it ... bu@@ ben im@@ pen@@ etr@@ able and clear@@ er or even rather opened , than against their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ory leaders , tru@@ sting teachers , etc .
that one speaks about sex with him ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up of interested students and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any fel@@ lowship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to link its good name with these war@@ med crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking ahead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and bl@@ ended in the coverage of a huge det@@ ective from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the abuse of the report .
clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , we say once , other alle@@ g@@ ations .
in addition , the report treats inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the cathedral @-@ scrap@@ ers .
all the horri@@ ble investig@@ ative ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were nar@@ row@@ ly schi@@ kan@@ ized and suffering from them , all of them participated in the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous states .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ cal &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report conclu@@ des that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , despite violence , combine positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in that he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school he will continue to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended an urgent intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity insi@@ sted when Prü@@ gel@@ stra@@ fen had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that they took place in a legal gray area , as each of us is well aware of .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the prison sentence of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate the past after today &apos;s moral standards .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what has been v@@ om@@ ited in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence on innocent children &apos;s sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s , that goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all horri@@ ble and I am happy that it is finally wound up .
but at the same time I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
its means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus drawing ear @-@ files and on the ha@@ irs and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then prohibited , it has kept strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his rainy season has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger returned in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mein Bruder der Papst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of the test also be subject to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , that the cathedral @-@ cats played only a secondary role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t know by no means that he led a stri@@ c@@ ter reg@@ iment there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even this has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand for un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ approval .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep @-@ believing and hear@@ ty people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could not do anything else .
I regularly receive , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his embar@@ king , regularly keep contact with him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him to this day , that he was once stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ ans are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and communicated them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and which they ad@@ ore down@@ right .
and please , once again quite clear : everything you imagine is educational methods , which were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is only too obvious the evil intent behind it .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him .
now the lawyer would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps nobody knows the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
