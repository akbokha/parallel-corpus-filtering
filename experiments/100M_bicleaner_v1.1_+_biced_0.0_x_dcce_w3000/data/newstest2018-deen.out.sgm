<seg id="1">Munich in 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich favours exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had to be upset because the car-Navi rather showed a green meadow instead of a circumstance road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter, were incorporated in cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lunéville of 9th February 1801: it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and therewith the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the map was created, so 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the today Plinganserstraße, which was named 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in the zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called "primordial-up" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots present no farmers there today - but small farmers of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 showplace of the October festival, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's District, Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "am Gasteig" "" "or at the height of" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse one once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, related to the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time, and for example ended the betting of the so-called" "" "Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Zsiren Penitentiary in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's biggest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Salesianum are now meeting in the area of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Irren facility, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Place" "", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once at Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn stem was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich-card with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the Promotion of Fares issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force until August 28, 2017, prompts afro-american travellers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents occur lately throughout the country and can be noted here," "" "said the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes people harder to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, which disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warning, said NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have infringements of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the voyage, and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Bureau of the Attorney General of Missouri, shown that black motorists in the state will be held 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to make chewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime amendment program of the FBI who ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations at the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws, oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling according to the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU President Peter White and Kordula Kovac have gained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the legal grabbing of the Schwendemann family representatives of the Fisherman CDU local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">At first Markus Schwendemann granted insight into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "black water milk" "" "is the alternative market for the milk of its cows, such as Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the holiday guests only regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the project as" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot operate on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, a lot of things must be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it did not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the afforestation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operations," "" "emphasised the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often under review due to the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the population was promoted by leaders, a quarter bore the community of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not do a good job without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß stood firm:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg permits the state promotion of electric fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to hold the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites are the presence of a subsidy named by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area must not be trapperable (slope over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The proposal of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence for the 2018 fish farm project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump régime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in an heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposal by the President for the drastic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boatowners and Liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it intervened, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller amoung Acosta: "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your idleness, your arms, / your oppressed masses who crave to breathe free, the miserable rubbish of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical figurative depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neoconservative, who brings the American flame into the world around: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elusive but hopeful people after long and often horrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump want to ever recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics via Facebook: do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the consent of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to its political principles.</seg>

<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>

<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked and erased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defended it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type of Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, blocking persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum called officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars are unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Mimia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasserted people who wield the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>

<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical disguises and to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But just this is happening digitally.</seg>

<seg id="422">In doing so, he has hitherto undercut that a part of the clients has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumpy figures on revenue increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less lustrous figure for the first time: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk has often advertised with the more than 500,000 orders for the new car, whose delivery has just started.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk is one: from the total of 518,000 orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and the United Kingdom 1000 Pounds) "Reservation payment."</seg>

<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year Tesla supplied 84.000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models should be combined - 500,000, 2020 a million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are 1800 bookings per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never in practice tested production lines without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche the old cemetery areal is invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historical St. Hilarius-plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tumours their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique little jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Urkundenbuch (Württembergischer Urkundenbuch): count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard from Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, the former parish church, besides the former parish church, was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or patronage was right and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As emerges from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the townscape of Tumour, the "mountain" is the third, the most beautiful settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The privilege of patronage came from the early medieval self-kirchenright.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, retired and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>

<seg id="481">The newly acquired bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later during World War II it had to be handed out in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) windows were infiltrated and the bell tower was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were located near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Hilarius-Cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from hearing schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm divided the bell tower and the half rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was canceled.</seg>

<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" summoned Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is done unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining city area.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are meant to prevent a "reduction" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days ago, the city of Viersen had decided a second wind energy concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette due to a change in the area of land use - but the district government in Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a formist.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was involved indirectly, closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-axle households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen's city council made green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge consisting of concrete, which is coated with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges run across the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red Buntsandstein.</seg>

<seg id="918">This is a boundary fixation, which is also used as an operating system.</seg>
<seg id="919">At the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metres wide bridge board is to be used on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football affect Neymars Moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars's World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that it must point out sometime that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and brings him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the wealthy family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to counter with legitimate income sources that allow them the break even point in their business related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, were effectively deceiving and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP setting, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in disgrace from the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare away from excessive expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the redemption sum for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players, instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlook their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market records, the UEFA would not count this as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG-payments to Neymar could come to Qatar about payments from the organizational committee of the 2006 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"" "" "" "but PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar will become a World Ambassador and would simply be easy to figure out such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators." ""</seg>
<seg id="1145">Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that, in 2015 / 16, a turnover of €542.4 million generated a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG believes Neymars's arrival is a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1174">Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the 80's characters, for the 90-er-years Grunge era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter hit the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise, it feels as if time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a promising tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By stiffing herself to the core of the gags - actor middle aged played horny children, who are grown up - still managed to win the last part of the joke.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who are playing adults now, is less emotional and his parody goes more to the foundry principle, among them a reef on the stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("Die Hand, die die Wiege schaukelt").</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "at one point, a character clashes through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" "" "a number of other things from 1991." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's sublippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random madness that could heel this franchise like a recurring "Seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I see as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the gang, how it will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its East-against-West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-minded Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon levels are synchronized in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags for watching (the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - creates a decent game 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer carrying a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">In six long episodes it moves there, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective" who was edited on a lower length could better deliver his Agitprop Satire, as Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary Communist audience is that western culture can do everything for the forage.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big living: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, crashed in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the incident.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel works are quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without losing ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous room the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable chicks are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a little engineering art went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counterweight so that when you push the door very easily glider." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that touch you and thus help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square meters of something standardly in something completely astonishingly.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation over one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco Jeans family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her late father Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominating personality" described in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of property and cash has turned out to be a point of issue for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the opinions proposed by Colin have left him with what I held for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed attempts.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - from what Colin, as Paul claims he has ruled him out.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance says that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports by companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicatessen business from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansladen of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"" "Colin says that he started Westco there when he was" "" "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other Brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group, where Colin claims that marks were paid $10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the President's Media Abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information in the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diät.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election functionaries there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that" "" "tumps Twitter habit has ever" "" "was" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trumps tweets would have included even more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers managed to keep anger from him several times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from causing trump contamination.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - entirely occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to lead the President for strategic reasons without questionable information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump as a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with humiliating leaks, and that he insists to find out where they originate from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a pile of leaks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chicans, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has sold false accusations in the past and has revoiced her.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These invariable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drifts in the Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctica a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the scarcely seven-times size of Berlin from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">Over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers large Koloss is now driving to the north and probably will need two, three years until it has melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is one of the largest ice gigants who have registered in the past three decades with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"" "" "" "to what extent climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg, is unclear after research data." ""</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of unusual quarantine fractures in the region for around 30 years, writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor behind.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims at the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this festivity the balance of waxes and breakage was disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete seshoe-file is there, AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate is under suspense and can fall apart if a piece is broken down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the glacier leads to the fact that the glaciers can drain directly into the sea and can flow more quickly than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in low measurements, the British research project writes about the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest scarlet of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the open ocean approximately 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural phenomenon and no direct connection to climate change is aware, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of records," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will continue to grow or fall back over the long term, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added:" "" "our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these scientists do not lead to the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many kingfishers of the Antarctic peninsula have been crumbling over the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme of the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In the last 50 years the Antarctic peninsula warmed up around three degrees and thus counted among the areas in which the temperature was at the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all allegations which are currently being raised, after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, which has been monitoring since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew adopts inflatable migrants who are delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can go down so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was alleged to be only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the public prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of taking away the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to stick to the code: save the Children, Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any "essential changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is Nobel Prize winner organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun seeing light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1628">For a long time, like in normal sport, leagues have established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>

<seg id="1632">Ingo FROBÖSE too has been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of panning the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but at normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he found himself among other things as a drawer for fortune-playing cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60's: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Time and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, rounded Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table, working almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his threatening figures continue to spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The protagonist in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordicless popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousandler as a counter-player.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures in the 3D film, which should come to the cinema wall in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.</seg>
<seg id="1793">The script is not written by him.</seg>
<seg id="1794">That's why he rather relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Lavender in Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought conditions and because of diseases committed to diseases, leading scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, large headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an effect on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small icade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf-calves, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ohren with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">"" "so we have less parts with essential oil." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drugs wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leaving them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and belly feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the salaries of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while in the whole country the bodies are piling up, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer by Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a probationary Attorney General was established in 2010, in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the killings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely placed in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolent and even though the terrain is still more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we suspend everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions are struggling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drugs kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was to not force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "was it impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the founding of Riodoce it received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" "" "for its coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that you consider as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead? why didn't you tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to curb like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and counsels, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is his love for routine be his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean stores, their secret starting and runways to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the annoyance is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no cell phones were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce runs on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of brother of former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state spending that concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group staying in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated the entire century all political layers.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this area, among them one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>

<seg id="1887">Reporters Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shading is usual, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur of sufficient pressure was hunted by meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the deterioration of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the shading - think of deer, zebras or madillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong carnivorous behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs carnivores must have been the chalk season," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life, including his conserved Darmakhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur when he died, fell into a river and was driven into the sea where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was as warm as Southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this nodosaur is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserved chapped skin, but also maintained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaur, that were standing on two legs, permeated the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was buried in the sea after death and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he dug in the Suncor millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the whispered dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3.000 pound (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous herbivores was flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaur's underwater book preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The fossils of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin fists still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a profit in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which almost resemble the cables hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from prison Fort Leavenworth, where former secrecy analyst served a 35-year sentence after she publicly disclosed the WikiLeaks website as a secret secret.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and made from 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, a sharp, although somewhat intellectual comment is not only created for the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white self-ie in which Manning is obviously sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts such as cigarette blouse and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit her at that time and she could not be photographed, so contact Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were turned into unequal bridles which during the course of two years interchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppressed Images," which foresaw a future in which the president Chelub's verdict would convert and it would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand was a welcome type of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little low and strong, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery called Manning with her superior signature among them (the "i" in her family name has been marked with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation was sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Speck Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is one side from the above mentioned comic novels.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are looking for suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been stabbed with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as reported by Cook County's official court.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say Cornell Duranleau, 26, after several engravings died.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system, published by the Chicago police authority, states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubicals, the Vice-President for University relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been rated to leave the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2169">A spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in every imaginable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be himself.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip that said that in apartment 1008 something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team at Grand Plaza has published an explanation to the inhabitants: "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," "" "said Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the Restore of Rusada and was recently published on the website of the Organization.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian Attorney General Richard McLaren for alleged doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has collapsed." ""</seg>

<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no state programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales agency rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "" "added Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015 Rusada was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia during the doping scandals of the WADA.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is best to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to enquire surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers manage to bypass the C-Suite leaders and direct themselves to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tool is used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>

<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap-Polls and Polls of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approvals - so that you can demand, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former colleague has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the "Let's Talk Payments" technical website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behaviour, saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the Uber case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Recently, uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, which allows employees to report bad behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints directly go to the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has seized regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves inethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified swiftly identified and addressed, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair traine-.</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology for monitoring ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups." ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">"" "" "" "glitzers secured a $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million." ""</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more jobs from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">High salaries and interesting projects are only assignments in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The staff want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Conversive and Glint."

<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if change is not fast enough or not at all, this can breed disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask about 4,000 inquiries, you will have to be ready to have 4,000 calls," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have left too much for collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about it, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employees surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-er and 1980-er years.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") this is all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that centuries spent in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape officers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only granted full access until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years, in which Aristocrats said," Oh, cast it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that portray who had something: "one could think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go their way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to divide on a broader basis into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of an uprising that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "" "says Rhodes." ""</seg>

<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit painter, who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', portrayed by the 18th century smugglers Arthur Darrell, who filled his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family from Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a grit, always making debt and spending money for things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landmines. "</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can't be crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking up their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern slums have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes more disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would allow a stepford woman to look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpo Dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, who gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," "" "warms the True Companion website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape if one goes one step on Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah, troubled the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy warns with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "it is said on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point out to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR recognizes their increasing popularity, they remain tentatively on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the edge zones can be very instructive with regard to the mind of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time in which the rights of women are threatened by the world in which there is a president in the White House who boasted to have attacked women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the eyes of the eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that points to independence or anything that could bother the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fraudulent slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the style of speech by 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Slumps of great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of common sense of life</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a reassurance of the Trump era that the political divisions, which polarized US voters, have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Festival, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all rigorously rigid to let our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less had been noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-looking poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican kinship, with whom she had fought for decades of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is related to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the decreasing effect of his presidency has the power to shift all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "", "and Trump we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens no longer meet us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing are" "" "normalized" "", "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urkomic version of madness falling - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return was out) - both in comparison to Trump seem to appear as very mild offense.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">As my cousin in the city, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the Karussells of the New York ParkAdministration, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals twisted to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perishing music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, as here two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to repel the valuation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to slowing what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excused, while I got tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wrist, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013 when he shot them through a door of the toilet cubicle at his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nightly intruder that hid himself in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Criminal Investigation Administration said that it would raise objection at the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of dissolving inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been observed that a kind of tolerance conducts immune cells in mice occurs, which carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium required tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan is more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movements, if the same system also swirls in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes the tolerance, when it found out that a group of academic mice had such cells, but another group of the same stem, which had been kept separately, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The dampers of mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice lacking.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they obtained the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an Indol-3-Lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophane values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastro-intestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>

<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who dealt with Ratzinger the memorandum "Mein Bruder der Papst" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the German lawyer Ulrich Weber in the 440-page report commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, the fact that Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other allegations, many victims assaulted the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories relate to it despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal was relieved at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence by force of protestants at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasise his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became tangible for the ointner when a Domspatz musically did not produce top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of complicity in complicity in complicity in sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the tyranny of violence at the pre-school took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can preach him to learn about it too late or not take first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatzengymnasium" "", "on which he appeared, was perceived by practically all respondents as - literally -" "" "redemption" "", "" "" "heaven" "", "" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotional emotionality, which has also led to outbursts.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only kneel with chairs and threw the key on the ground, but also forgave ear-ceremonies and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself has given himself years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the tyrancion eating at the pre-school, this is admittedly Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more familiar with his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope, many who never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees "qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger published in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk with my father or mother about it," "" "said a person who was affected by the others," "" "Everything was very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem in the clarification of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-pupils Ratzinger's role in regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a sought after student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that out of it... buben impenetrable and clearer or even rather opened, than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trusting teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks about sex with him... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this is how the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "in the run-up of interested students and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any fellowship.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad." ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link its good name with these warmed crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking ahead" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and blended in the coverage of a huge detective from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the cathedral-scrapers.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible investigative pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were narrowly schikanized and suffering from them, all of them participated in the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous states.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on the one hand, as most witnesses emphasise, the topic" "" "Vorschule" "" "tabu." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisical" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, despite violence, combine positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in that he points out this," "" "that in the pre-school he will continue to practice the punishment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "" "" "already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent intervention." ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity insisted when Prügelstrafen had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they took place in a legal gray area, as each of us is well aware of.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the prison sentence of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards to the time of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the "pitfall of anachronism," thus the danger to evaluate the past after today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (TV)</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what has been vomited in the pre-school of adversity and violence on innocent children's shrimps, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am happy that it is finally wound up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means of disciplining and punishment, thus drawing ear-files and on the hairs and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
