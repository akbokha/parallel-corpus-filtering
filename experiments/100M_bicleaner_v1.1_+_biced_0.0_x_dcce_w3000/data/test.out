&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim has said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who previously worked as a chef in Boston , had secured his dream job as a chef in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they sho@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

anyone who has the information in the event will be asked to call the tran@@ script of the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m getting into drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers or stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are more schn@@ u@@ ppe to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her being &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan Center .
most of the time , the ac@@ tress sp@@ ends her time at home , a television with delicious de@@ br@@ is and mex@@ ican food , called it in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as an all@@ uring mother of two sons .
the film runs on August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues sought a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden Sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses were remin@@ is@@ cent of their f@@ estiv@@ ity , they hun@@ ted in the fast g@@ allo@@ p home to the feeding trou@@ gh@@ s .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with this the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament vict@@ ories - again near horses .
he let himself lead with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he was not even for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed the man out of An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the golden pyramid of sport .
there is no lack of awards to the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ erb@@ latt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sports successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,@@ 000 Euros equal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold US Mast@@ ers@@ si@@ eger was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ asts of Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ gger Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ ehmer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ tur@@ adion , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Compar@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump want to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are , however , in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophi@@ cal difference . &quot; &quot; &quot;
der , about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt small and cau@@ tions against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claimed Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely rep@@ atri@@ ate regulations , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
therefore , taxes would be increased for the rich , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ut@@ e- wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could thus come to party @-@ internal discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more clearly are the differences in energy and climate policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas ; he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand the renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the d@@ rank @-@ fish trade agreement , don &apos;t want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs .

the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wages .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what g@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics uph@@ old him , that the budget deficit would only grow t@@ aller .
on the other side , Clinton , who would at least want to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of women who are fle@@ eing on their own , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son into his arm .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother gaz@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is a business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are P@@ oultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs created the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s assistance .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a bear@@ er of hope to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , there are other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate House@@ wives
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs require a sexual act for a bottle of water , is no rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that about 90 per cent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , there are more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their competence area , some respond with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in the accom@@ od@@ ations of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separately accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read out at the cr@@ ush that there is at the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has spoken that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors strei@@ ken : demands for new employment campaigns
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work combat activities from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have given ministers to deal with the concerns about the contract .
in July , Assi@@ sts and Medical Stud@@ ents have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Executive Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ ited official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council , in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that assist@@ ants were struck by six times this year , the first total cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during meetings that were still held before the vote by 54@@ .000 officers and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was sm@@ alli@@ ble and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved like never had happened to happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introdu@@ ctory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin par@@ ted and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia .
the off@@ ense was even bigger , since it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the v@@ ow becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks would blame for all .
most seriously , the accus@@ ations of senior officials were that Erdo@@ gan had benef@@ itted his own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate House@@ wives
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan as he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was released last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ ais@@ led rush to the Mediterranean .
this week the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian impor@@ ters are again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti already formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West because it looks at its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ vot@@ al to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian leader in Ankara won with certainty a bonus that he called for support for the elected government bodies after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep @-@ seated fear of reg@@ iment .
the summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an analy@@ st as it once described to me to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel badly treated and now alli@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents were saying that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey clearly avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey sh@@ uts off Russian mar@@ tial jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk together at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland NO longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Chief Executive Officer , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time brand strateg@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sports with millions of pounds at Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don Champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor @-@ brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals but also local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ourselves ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market

the Jo@@ ckey @-@ Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , who is trained by John Gos@@ him , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori adju@@ sts the che@@ er when he won the title on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 vict@@ ories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career vict@@ ories
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct , which differs from the others in the control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma thr@@ illed fans for this kind of sport for many years .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already obtained 6,000 gains if he was not just a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden nearly 30 years of winner , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat race for two decades now .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties initially when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to with@@ stand his two fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .

Russian Putin fired Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ is@@ sed his chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ant .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters .
in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin allegedly ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is ( in Russian ) that he was later Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the Government Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV broad@@ c@@ aster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended as his successor .
are the sm@@ iling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow a mysterious place .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov spent a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ors and worked as he was for Soviet intelligence , K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted to be a potential president , at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to talk to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to confi@@ de for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Put@@ ins &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term of Put@@ ins had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest ally Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announ@@ cing his dism@@ iss@@ al .
on the set there came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
I regret the incident , &quot; he said in a message .
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season will be staged on September 28th .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff

Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ t rop@@ es .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown attended the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closing between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the whole deck ceiling is at its place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks today gets a g@@ ong for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck situated in the expansion , we had to close the existing gap on the north or south side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 222 meters long , weighs approximately 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % upwards .
delicate since the toler@@ ances on which the team were working , were tiny - on each side they only have a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat ahead of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI lifer@@ aft was hit by 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat revol@@ ved around and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was spent at the age of 60 and was found on a bu@@ oy without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the bo@@ ating motor had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who was controlling the boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has awak@@ ened today about these men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seriously injured - man smo@@ kes his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to get his personal belong@@ ings .

when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .

together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
but she was not able to persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companion of life .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds cheap apartments of Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens think : investors should be taken more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that in the next few years Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next install@@ ment session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas will in future indicate 20 percent of all flats as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favourable apartments can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the major issue in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 percent of the housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new municipal housing development program that will cost millions and still needs to be financed is to provide incen@@ tives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left still wants to tough@@ en jobs for investors .
regardless of that , as Brat@@ mann , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but still the programme does not fully stand : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compens@@ ate for the loss of some 1,@@ 300 favourable apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the years to come ?
up to the year 2020 , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought off @-@ running ties from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the Western city .
the problem can be solved at one stroke .
for in the Western city run for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments can be found there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the Western city is again dras@@ tically increased , one remo@@ ves from the goal of the so @-@ called interference .
there should not be a concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the C@@ DU must take the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside for playing anymore but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , star@@ ing on screens , compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not excl@@ ude one another .
I &apos;m of course referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later this resulted in a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture , interest prior to the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in early July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand the servers were over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon , who are tracking with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the car and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person tables every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35,@@ 000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people who exercis@@ ed 30 minutes each day , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays out Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 minutes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get active from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look el@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
anyone who drives sport regularly reduces their chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close up new friends on the hunt .
as usual , there are also m@@ ür@@ rische Spiel@@ corrupt , who must always compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what does it mean ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
however , because of Pok@@ emon &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on hunting , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the D@@ ament@@ urns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es ist auf all das im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast climb@@ ed on Thursday to the multi @-@ fight title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the bri@@ quet of the women during the individual competition in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman winning a multi @-@ fight title and a total of the fifth as she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even ever .
she broke into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
she puts this success in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver medals at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an excl@@ am@@ ation badge during the f@@ are@@ well party of the team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted to never have planned the future during their long road , this is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coinci@@ dence .
this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last for as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly by two rot@@ ations , the picture sm@@ ashed .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title .
she repeated with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the bri@@ be beam again - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
R@@ ais@@ man gently embrac@@ ed her as she expected her grand@@ child - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ wed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book , became reality .
the performance of R@@ ais@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggl@@ ed for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ aine , which is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her floor exercises she threw the audience kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the ninet@@ een @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et of the ninet@@ een @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in the car in series mur@@ der@@ ers
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series of mur@@ der@@ ous mur@@ der@@ ers of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker included not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks within four months and two more injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not un@@ common for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was put on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ ics and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the few of his ageing , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know about her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t create that .
after that I did not let myself in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has insi@@ sted on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you were told that Ed@@ mund could never recognize them and that he might not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of an aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cra@@ wl until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he progres@@ ses slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth is showing the sign language that Ed@@ mund has suspected for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund had invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on Friday the emergency . it is expected all Saturday with more rain .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ds to extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards informed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared with that the requests for flood @-@ vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could drop to rain .
in the south of Alab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was still raining in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the subur@@ ban areas near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that an up@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these flows only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the rivers .
the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &apos;s border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , already reached 09@@ .00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams still tied up people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek water , which normally lies more than 400 feet from his house , climb@@ ed heavily over night .
he said that another step @-@ son , who lives near , would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water was flowing and flowing in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a rise of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in one big military truck and brought them to the nearest fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated up to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been significantly out@@ weigh@@ ed by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities announced that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and street floo@@ ds caused the rescue of indigenous people from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and lessons in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a side ordered in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated to two churches which were both floo@@ ded .
the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship of the commun@@ e Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floo@@ ds .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated ones .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the flood water and sand bags for the residents are provided that hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it was still raining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as floo@@ d@@ lit , but no reports were reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; Rev@@ en@@ ched by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police inform@@ s that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown had suffered several fir@@ ing injuries , including in the lo@@ ft , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was en@@ qu@@ en@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered cri@@ tically in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two aged 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , reported the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could be .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross @-@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge cat@@ ches for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , sur@@ rendered to the Tat@@ ort .
it seems that it was clearly a prolonged struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were seals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia dem Sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and police are currently under review of the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross @-@ r@@ ack@@ et on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police still searches for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than a reason .
first of all I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color inspir@@ ational .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , is the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lics , rounds out , makes everyone proud .
this team finally mirrors the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tik@@ routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ fight event for women .
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
we experience the peak of this sport , but do not look like gymn@@ as@@ tics classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ ner is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts come first and foremost in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents , who pay for training , set @-@ up , travel and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of this turn@@ out lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner receives their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and more accessible gymn@@ asi@@ um training .
I have founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,@@ 000 urban teenagers ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trains national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth a high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and than@@ king you so many young girls with varying backgrounds motivated to get their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ .000 officers who voted for a vote refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July H@@ unt had un@@ veiled plans to for@@ ge the contract and said that the N@@ HS had been found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be det@@ ri@@ mental . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first practitioners are supposed to have a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at day @-@ to @-@ day care .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assi@@ sts , announced last night in a notification with : &quot; practitioners have serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current affiliate crisis and meet all the doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by talks tac@@ kled by the government to take part and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now , lift up the condition and address the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in helping doctors on the strike chain cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants a better re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 assistance doctors , who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat measures achieve nothing of the only little , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we have spoken to the investig@@ ator committee and responded positively to the ministry of health and other mini@@ stri@@ es regarding concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ om .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning adher@@ ence to agreements with B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro tag@@ - drug that can lower heart attacks
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ acting medication Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of it suff@@ ers another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , forming the floor@@ ings .
when the si@@ ege breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solve , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the pi@@ pe@@ work of NI@@ CE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the NI@@ CE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively reduces other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
by recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves election districts flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread elec@@ toral fraud in Muslim communities is kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles ob@@ serves the police , ob@@ servers and Rath@@ houses for ignor@@ ing evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off tapes outside elec@@ toral cabins to protect en@@ forced vot@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that vot@@ ers should lead to their identity in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present a vot@@ er must mention his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non removable ink to the finger of a person if they give their vote to prevent someone who choos@@ es twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to church records and decisions of not official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against elec@@ toral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered from Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court court decided that Mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was to be dism@@ is@@ sed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia alle@@ g@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign is based on the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation in which one person choos@@ es someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he vo@@ iced mainly al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter @-@ election - when the older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including guiding the way out to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the older , in particular communities with Pakistan or b@@ ang@@ les@@ bian background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... governmental institutions have kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric mentioned 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists deal with postal voting documents in order to stop &quot; poll@@ s . &quot;
the report , which is being contempl@@ ated by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for harder registration checks to prevent the elec@@ toral list being used for immigration and social fraud .
considering options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choos@@ es twice .
systematic reviews of the nation@@ ality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on requests to an automatic mail @-@ election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists deal with complete let@@ ter@@ ings and envel@@ op@@ es of let@@ ter@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police give the authority to set up lock@@ outs for elec@@ tive stations .
a change of law , which alle@@ vi@@ ates an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( National Assembly Law 1983 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fot@@ ograf@@ ier@@ ver@@ bot in Wahl@@ kampf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
requirement that only English must be used in the elec@@ toral units ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out that vot@@ ers go alone in the elec@@ toral cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amaz@@ ingly &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ele@@ ction Court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ as@@ hable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spread of elec@@ toral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger von Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio have gone over the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of the edge and the band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ crossing of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to make gold fighting ath@@ l@@ ete , which has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if you are allowed to believe the social media faith .
in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans who have more than just some simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the rac@@ etr@@ ack many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain arch@@ er of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a storm on Twitter after images on which he looked closely resem@@ bling the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy distributed the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess it is a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is meant to be a double gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee &apos;s Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user is the opinion that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova depic@@ ts more than just sun @-@ fried skin and blond hair like ac@@ tress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while American Nathan att@@ es@@ ed Adrian von Goisern to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory into space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to the ac@@ tress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , broad smile , resem@@ bling Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a pig is dead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ D@@ onal@@ ds analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Hai@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free @-@ sty@@ led spectators of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comm@@ ent@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; how low went off &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comm@@ ent@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ D@@ onal@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he set his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS &apos;s comm@@ ent@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , he went like a pig , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers Ai Hai@@ han , 14 , spon@@ ge the second stage of the flo@@ ats 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadi@@ ans to open the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and the language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; just like a pig died ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Hai@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many spoke to him
Twitter @-@ users didn &apos;t go back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for over 90 times among the people who responded to the Twitter about Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator colleague Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ d@@ onald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night with our spectators on the show and our followers in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ fortunate wording . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald exc@@ used in the broadcast and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the Frau@@ ensch@@ wi@@ mm@@ st@@ aff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I listened to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about woman who tast@@ ed under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to look when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she mut@@ ed how she looked at it , pulled her off and put her back into the shelf .
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where woman tast@@ ed the pants before she put them back to the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried the under@@ wear , she turned back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the box , she took a pair of pants off the display , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tast@@ ed her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a dis@@ crete place to do it - she was simply there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled off the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that her liked nothing to be d@@ anced again and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone observing - or thinking about the person who could buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how hard to think that someone would take shelter with home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and did not wash it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place at our branch in Folk@@ stone on Tuesday 9 August . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question have been pulled out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com might make him a bit more secure .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from front or back , this video will show you how to flip the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you approach you from behind then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the gro@@ in and twist , while the att@@ acker cr@@ ushes against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards while holding the gun on him .
in att@@ ackers , approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time shift the weight to the gun and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon from its grip , before moving back@@ wards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ fers Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to over@@ ride your money - if you are not a cl@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Rei@@ sender Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went a serious test of his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex - by cont@@ acting some of Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places .
the present@@ er and trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k moved his course on a euro bill , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
in front of the lick of each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and show us what he will let himself be .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med by The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea of emp@@ t@@ ying the pur@@ ge of a pull @-@ up toil@@ ette , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he lick , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known for testing the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by riding through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ways to train stations to rin@@ se heads of toilets , the task presented his immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was justified in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ be@@ ak showed a lumin@@ ometric rate of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric rate of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to le@@ ak after its lumin@@ ometric rate was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of Mil@@ k products vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I ger@@ o@@ wed in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to dock here because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of Mil@@ ky Products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I had instruc@@ ted him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys before del@@ og@@ ging social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ oba were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls exp@@ elled openings , wooden boards were torn , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the home administration at Corn@@ wall Housing said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as nice part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ licted , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all bats , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive typ@@ ing , disputes and floo@@ ds .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house which may be demoli@@ shed under certain circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found
they were tra@@ ded in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were ri@@ pped
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ging her and her partner for@@ ci@@ bly by the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have given the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years
on the out@@ grown side of the municipal property , waste and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant cop@@ ed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step taken into consideration of Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horri@@ ble for their neigh@@ bors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously visited us and have provided us with information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .

workers of the House Administration will now have to grant budgets that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine of money , after having found the owner of a class B drug in trade @-@ confidence .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were without shelter , it was assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will be del@@ og@@ ging ten@@ ants who don &apos;t cling to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the Dev@@ onian police and Corn@@ wall informed that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without compl@@ ac@@ ency as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal placed in panic after a ti@@ eff@@ able military jet beach over@@ flies
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ es P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ strip plane put an incredible crash
the air forces admitted that it was on a training flight , but ins@@ ulated that there was no security risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after a ti@@ eff@@ able jet falls over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ots showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun wor@@ ms on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers rose up when they were understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice really very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ uno Arro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were displac@@ ed in panic when the plane came from the darkness and flew incredibly low .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on air@@ plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the bad visibility of the area , the jet flo@@ cks flew lower than usual , but the air forces ins@@ ist that safety was at no time at risk .
floo@@ ds have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on Madeira Island were killed .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with sorrow to Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the return game rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the double @-@ winner must for@@ ego in the forces of forces with the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reig@@ ning Europe le@@ ague champion among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre ter St@@ egen is also missing .
the German suffered an alter@@ ation in the training in the training , with which the request at Bar@@ ca was at least clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are ranked number one in Barcelona for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique had so far reno@@ un@@ ced a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining applicants had the preliminary step .
in front of the first mandatory event of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ s@@ als stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
Sev@@ ille again defeated the 2 : 3 defeat after leng@@ th@@ ening in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner of the record winner in this race .
MA Long in an own le@@ ague to Table Tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis court winner .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5@@ 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World tran@@ sports first took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top@@ most Olympia stair@@ way was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with themselves .
they had pulled back to the grand@@ stand and left their def@@ enders in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
MA had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang in a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma not the expected ro@@ using match developed .
however , nevertheless , there were enough stunning ball changes to be seen .
Miz@@ pe@@ h won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ r@@ ussi@@ c had drawn a ri@@ b@@ bed injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle &quot; with sheet metal .

Donald Tr@@ ump spatial ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative states .
Donald Tr@@ ump , presidential candidate , gave now the weaknesses of his campaign in the present Republi@@ can high castle Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gau@@ ged and self @-@ confident multi @-@ milli@@ on@@ aire such as concerns vo@@ iced how correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals from the race within his own republi@@ can camp , doubts arise in his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blame were false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he picked up his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can bur@@ sts w@@ ack@@ y
Ut@@ ah is usually a safe bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
other institutes view Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question how he wanted to stop the alle@@ g@@ ations of Clin@@ tons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards , this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not do anything else than to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of political correctness , it is al@@ right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to submit money to the support of its elec@@ toral campaign , it should not present any better survey values .
instead of this , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans would be more strongly affected by the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : three @-@ ster sc@@ am at dop@@ ing test &quot; &quot; &quot;
the I@@ OC wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach back home .
the International Olympic Committee agreed to promptly set up a discipline Commission in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials told us that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to team leader Ken@@ ias by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the World Federation IA@@ AF has asked the I@@ OC for information about the case in order to rig@@ ate its own investigations , shared a IA@@ AF spokes@@ person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following actions of the I@@ OC the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and has spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed down and signed , &quot; stated Kenya Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the athletes , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup @-@ Vier@@ ter over 800 meters .
four days before , Ken@@ yan Leicht@@ athle@@ tik @-@ Deleg@@ ation@@ sch@@ ef Michael Rot@@ ich had been with@@ drawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against money payments by his country .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has been under special observation at the I@@ OC after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ enses already since a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target inspec@@ tions presented by the I@@ OC in front of the Rio Games , un@@ common attention has been pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into sight .
before the summer Olympics in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency exer@@ ted much pressure on African land to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
subsequently , the W@@ ADA joined Kenya from the list of countries whose Dop@@ ing Control is compliant with W@@ ADA &apos;s rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in the Russian Athle@@ tics Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type , nation@@ wide and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from summer play .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s master@@ piece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temples of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melo@@ dy .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have am@@ ber music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she rec@@ alls with sorrow to her love with Tony , while the younger sister plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all !

London School M@@ aid , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , IT@@ V news on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ ached to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London moved to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas family was told that she married a I@@ SIS milit@@ ant in Syria and became wi@@ dow within a few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor to the late Jud@@ ge on Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman spokes@@ woman later said that he had not spoken to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , are lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes itself since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy for men is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the representation of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the publication of the cal@@ end@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community pays for mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t adapt and Erdo@@ gan is engaged , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pres@@ idency of the Gü@@ len @-@ draws foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany pays short notice with tens of thousands of people who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the hard drive of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand asylum seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government has already passed Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ alties for months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey .
after the fro@@ sted put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Tur@@ ks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start ane@@ w in Europe if they are suppres@@ sed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees even in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef compl@@ ained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
so Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the reis@@ su@@ e to the remaining cur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a C@@ DU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef demanded that the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
more Tur@@ ks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ marking as a Gü@@ len @-@ Trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t adapt to Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ affiliated Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Interior Ministry , the Tur@@ ks set up the largest group of asylum @-@ entitled asylum seek@@ ers approved for political persecution in Germany .
on June 30 , there were 11,@@ 386 people , and thus nearly 29 percent of all as asylum seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 625 ) have been entitled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , it is not the question of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because more stupid than hi@@ ther@@ to it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and country @-@ sw@@ inging combat - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the candidates , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the countryside , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not local people , so they are not allowed to choose the country day .
in addition , practical problems come : in the holidays there are hel@@ pers , posters hanging , ballo@@ ons infl@@ ating , distribut@@ ing fl@@ yers and counting on the end of votes , only lab@@ orious .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go past the people once again with an election campaign .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / C@@ DU coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the C@@ DU in poll@@ s .
it is exciting how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tions .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of head since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous elec@@ toral campaign , one sees from its large posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little bit with the people , just as his legendary spokes@@ man predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise sailors have got cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel &apos;s gu@@ ilt on the flour@@ ishing of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU , with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaign at the wrong time .
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel for major manifest@@ ations ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group lies in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony , as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the C@@ DU in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s a shame to anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ C@@ DU relies mostly on the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that on the land you are br@@ ushing the ground that it needs to be very rig@@ orous to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely any in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the C@@ DU elec@@ toral fighter Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : festivals , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD a particularly committed campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner C@@ DU ( 25 ) and just slightly ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won with 35.@@ 6 percent before the C@@ DU ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , should create the leap into the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday disaster and put their elec@@ toral campaign largely into the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ tors go on search for domestic stimul@@ ants under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Silke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg L@@ akes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wahl@@ urlaub in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there is nothing to compl@@ ain about speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 o &apos;clock , there is praise everywhere .
&quot; they made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff explains from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October everything should be ready .
the fee is also being paid to those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of cab rides .
since the construction site has been immig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is restored , the traffic situation in the town is relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asi@@ ve road through the village seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ lauf@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sne@@ e@@ lanes were seeking and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i as sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ k in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not observed , the municipality also called on the mass @-@ vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made herself well informed on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already two to three per minute heated .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 Hours of Hours in the Tempo @-@ 30 Zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become more quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look at the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ R @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales revenues , everyone lets you look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most moderate decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ackno@@ wle@@ dges that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the race is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the areas along the road are most heavily sha@@ ken .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers in H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; started its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ is@@ sed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt requested a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , it also has to bear the dis@@ advantages that arise due to the rehabilitation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other rural districts where such a little more generous was handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 and refers to the long history .
that other regular guests are now seeing less frequently because of complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you cannot drive , it is also somewhere else .
that his tri@@ bal climate returns to the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
in the name of counter @-@ fighting , laws are constantly being scre@@ wed to laws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , the Minister of the Interior of Mai@@ zi@@ ère now faces a big security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a toler@@ ant status do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the dryer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister for the performance of his new safety package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t call for anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as the Minister of the Interior , he was located on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been known , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU direc@@ tives for passenger information and ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck out ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with dual citizenship the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the C@@ DU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he still ret@@ ains this for reasonable and doesn &apos;t require anything that has no chance at the coalition partner .
a few new ideas are presented at Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick @-@ proceedings for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deport@@ ation .
refugees that are specifically fet@@ ched into the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of toler@@ ations for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than hi@@ ther@@ to - such as those who commit crimes or disc@@ ard their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are political and legal .
some of them are still un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and at some point - in the ine@@ quality of im@@ bal@@ ances - for example - raises the question : what exactly does it have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in the face of the high tide of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that people deeply concerned would not be cl@@ amped even in election campaigns .
the inner security is enormous in the spot@@ light .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly focuss@@ ed on internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past days , there was a high rise between the two parties .
only a gar@@ sty contro@@ vers@@ y about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the local leaders also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
he considers nothing of a revers@@ al of the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have limited the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ open it is not useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in a bur@@ ka ban , he has a constitutional complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its own par@@ cel is constitutional in all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot in it , which could cause dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even the SPD is trying to pro@@ claim internal security in the matter of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming through .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the ex@@ tradition figures are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term .
Volkswagen starts delivering deliveries to the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the VW brand weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thereby res@@ um@@ ed the total sales , as announced in the D@@ ax company .
worldwide , the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , in China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
sales of Mark Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann pushed the we@@ aker numbers from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has given a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buying back &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes have escal@@ ated first , a minus is also available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is already leg@@ alized by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a breakdown minus of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is be@@ ech .
from January to July , Group sales head , Fred Kap@@ pler , continued to present a sales office .
in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software crash test .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling some 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer places the customer after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal entities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now considering its German customers a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry committee and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Bundes@@ verkehr@@ sm@@ ini@@ ster Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power do not take place after the retro@@ fit , and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , for example , a half year after the conversion will come into a workshop with engine damage - and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage , which have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , cause uncertainty about potential warranty regulations , as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest from rich spar@@ s in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : normal savings would have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay pen@@ alties for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , they must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee requires Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he kept 40 million euros , who could be with@@ drawn from one day to another and which he could not evaluate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ uter principle , the costs are now given further .
letting the cash simply lie in the banks of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank@@ note .
most customers would have an understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co @-@ operative association Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you alone can bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ - und Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their skat@@ Bank Fili@@ ale 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay deposits for deposits , and competition in Germany is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele which is a bit more luxuri@@ ant from assets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she paid money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs res@@ ide in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no further banks are known which comp@@ ute a stock replacement for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into the neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be able to please that in the wide range .
destination plates : who does buy records ?
lon@@ es@@ ome middle aged men love plates .
before comm@@ enting on the comm@@ ent@@ ator part to over@@ see him under the p@@ seud@@ onym Non @-@ Alle@@ m@@ ant men &apos;s middle age with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lied resurrection of vinyl records is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers group .
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plate sellers retain their emotions rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog is a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I go in the midst of a busy street in S@@ oho , a modest gray suit and wild , before I stop standing , keeping my hands and a bit of determining how : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ hos is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ eram@@ an to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by watching them .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 by Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three men of middle aged ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle aged , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is it a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his sitting room .
the reason why he has such a si@@ zable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and re @-@ buy objects he sold when he was young and pl@@ eite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought probably was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets are true to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also not@@ ices a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy back their old records .
from the conversations I have led , people usually got rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional relevance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ o@@ thing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that aw@@ aken happy youth memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or poss@@ essions of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to be mentally engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee inf@@ ects a stack of records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet stopped .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this point of the news report , I would probably look very concerned as I smoo@@ ther through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of numbers : three men of middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here just recently and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who only slowly come into being .
stop , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a smaller audience than I pur@@ port .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , te@@ ens and women middle aged .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - wild be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ ually packed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ils from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ ma can be hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather makes a shop window than a wholesale purchase .
it does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I pret@@ end to mu@@ te the jeans jacket , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one most suitable for luxury items such as records .
even though my research has yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they are dis@@ regarded , at least in record shops in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors in reality , record shops and online searches .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they do not spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bo@@ omer@@ ang through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through panels , while they avoid the star@@ ring look of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who rises above the shoulders nothing of middle aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of stores in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live .
at a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ visional shops in which persons within the camp offer goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , offer bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that they have a fire and health risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also concluded that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people running the 72 pro@@ visional shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely comprehensi@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer calm meetings between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , which is char@@ itable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the jungle lasted more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympia @-@ dis@@ appointment : Martin stays milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the olymp@@ ic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin does not want to make himself entert@@ ained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep going on the World Cup , remain confident and fight on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not give an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar @-@ hut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly say it &apos;s hard to comment on the time run of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he needed to analyse the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Championship in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time World Champion , who on Wednesday lost 5@@ 4,5 km more than three minutes at the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er needs to be tuned to the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ tening devices are tested which will effectively over@@ lap tem@@ pos .
the fut@@ uris@@ tically acting En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at random points , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limit .
a durable mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as pass @-@ up b@@ ans according to time , carri@@ ages and vehicle classes can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be fitted with a trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply stolen , it is lo@@ wered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way disappear also a sh@@ atter @-@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to indications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ er rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the Great Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ year rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro Stadium .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the massive defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji in this form would have struck a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in best form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , she lost each game at the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonder@@ fully and let the attacks G@@ Bs had fun boun@@ cing off .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . an as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ inis went down in the corner .
with only four minutes of playing , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a h@@ emis@@ pher@@ ical t@@ opping of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the hill from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a l@@ ete a tou@@ ch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB still un@@ learned .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a tou@@ ch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ try , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach to Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle so@@ unded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged themselves and GB k@@ ick@@ te sm@@ ashed in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown raised the bu@@ cks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and there@@ with the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than in these games and that wants to be what you want .
from the first stroke until the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when she was a second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports who put such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 39.@@ ite un@@ disp@@ uted use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sp@@ ong@@ es , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind each gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and it was no lifting up to the trainer , who did not know if he was diagnosed with cancer this day 30 months ago .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept inter@@ ruption to a minimum if it is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money so I had to go better soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
that &apos;s how it starts .
the rowing of itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts came to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ re@@ aring morning with a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was as Captain in the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank goes to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents did not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called , &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not anx@@ ious to make something rab@@ bit .
today we did not want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years presented exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as an example for the large water producers .
so it was the name of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk before some time ago .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken wor@@ shipped the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe gel@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband workforce , stands for 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approx . 15@@ 0,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was appointed as a Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency sets at weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land acquis@@ itions in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refur@@ bish@@ ment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there has been no down@@ time and one has repeatedly added innovations because water is de@@ hydr@@ ated and pot@@ able water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dation they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practition@@ er , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia District .
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller for his part praised Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best sail@@ or and he was a faithful man .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a high point from his point of view , he described the well @-@ making and re @-@ structuring of the purpose of the purpose .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the break@@ down@@ s at the high @-@ pressure tank at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn have to be maintained once only because one filled up the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and applies to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
but the now eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well advanced and now ler@@ ess in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years back when I sang at La Scala , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man sho@@ ots at risk
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45@@ am and injured her deadly wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has inv@@ oked and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him I will be publicly det@@ ained .
meanwhile nation@@ wide because Sven S. could be traveling by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ burnt and has a roller .
in the meantime , the police has published a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a candle .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with himself , so the police .
anyone who sees Sven S. will call 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the police in Lübeck wanted to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpet@@ rat@@ ors and victims ; but they confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a massacre of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t currently say more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application ando ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
Stahl - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened from green electricity generation are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Plant in the existing facilities of the so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with a competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but also this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on self @-@ electricity generation .
in this way , the status quo of the current regulation will be largely written .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be subsi@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation wor@@ sen@@ ed further as the world &apos;s largest producer in China faced massive steel on the world market given the we@@ aker domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties have effect on import steel action , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen .
un@@ clear is how sustainable the price re@@ petition is .
German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp cau@@ ti@@ ously remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost re@@ ductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to excl@@ ude last but also the closing of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the steel economic union announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the teaching office she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and more vivid , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and spirit .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Sen@@ ior@@ en@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can establish and cultivate social contacts .
because often social and family structures dis@@ solve at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a chor@@ us is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so quickly out of the box in everyday life .
even though it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice in age , singing is an ideal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Sen@@ ioren @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , explains it .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs awak@@ ens many memories in older people , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
due to lyrics and especially melo@@ dy , even demen@@ tia @-@ related people are sin@@ king back to long @-@ lying events .
when singing , the head is also demanded a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
focusing on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I prac@@ tise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes beside it ?
in search of the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior choir , one can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neigh@@ bors for help with the internet research .
anyone wanting to sing should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a cat to Schrei@@ e of the young
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover what effect the calling of cat litter on adult animals has .
to their surprise , the che@@ wing also did not let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of cat bu@@ ys at the mi@@ sting of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to the lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great distress , as scientists have found out from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ sts of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens is different with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult males and eight females from the keeping of the MH@@ H have been observed .
they were played for a har@@ p of little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally lifted up .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample of the sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , differenti@@ ated differenti@@ ated to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned swi@@ ft@@ ly to the speaker when this calls were played by the very ti@@ ghter k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises .
some studies showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , whether they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been issued an arrest warran@@ t against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , another important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ val Ri@@ val between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even in the attempt to susp@@ end the state of emergency after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected .
this is not true for those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt .
this is also not done before football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
accordingly , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is said to be followers of the Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is in charge of the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the attempted coup attempt .
although the initial state of emergency is still valid for 90 days until October , in fact , it has as good as no effects on the life of most Tur@@ ks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what the anger of the Tur@@ ks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will especially arrive on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celebrated it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europa League early . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the SÜ@@ PER Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the game year ran better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title as a SÜ@@ PER @-@ Li@@ g Tor@@ cher King .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez bor@@ rowed from the AC Florence under contract and delivered only bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez after the attempted coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the stor@@ ms would have to be willing to reno@@ un@@ ce around a third of its annual income to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa cannot start in Rio .
other over@@ powered athle@@ tics sinn@@ ers can only laugh - they fight in Rio for medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was gr@@ acious and fl@@ atten@@ ed at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
there was a sc@@ ur@@ ry scene : with a sm@@ iling smile she was still stum@@ bling into the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
as a matter of fact that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are still plenty of other sports@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the Rio Olympics despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than ever , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down in 2010 a six @-@ month lock after it was detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested for the banned ant drug Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic denied entry and was closed six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great J@@ ail@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Te@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positively in 2010 and was closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , bet@@ ro@@ thed Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ hart , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete had seen so many medals afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost its World Cup title nine years later after it was established with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympics silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also trac@@ ed back to CAS due to a verdi@@ ct of the International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record scientist and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may nevertheless start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the sperm of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ADA fell mil@@ de and went off on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Österreich@@ erin injured - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man for the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but had already left it again .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also Austrian citizens , it is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quad@@ rup@@ ed out of two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two j@@ ets went up again , while another man was killed by the authorities .
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
after police information , a taxi driver was injured when det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of the island of Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives went into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called for several wounded in the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast .
you walk from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks have the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks which are typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not be related to the Islamic revol@@ t movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that bombs were put down by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities would have kept secret information on forth@@ coming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they were not informed of the exact date and place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not yet un@@ clear which group behind the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police instruc@@ ted their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the well @-@ known bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security agencies .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) paid for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its en@@ vir@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary journeys to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday carried out a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ unta .
this gives the military great influence even in the years to come .
j@@ unta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , who had seized power in 2014 following a phase of bloody un@@ rest , ad@@ ministers themselves to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok , an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ ine 20 people had been killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has come to the Vis@@ or of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several state offices also the constitutional shel@@ ters in the Con@@ federation have also set the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Democratic Basic Order &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Constitutional Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß der Deutschen Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it applies to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moder@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that his authority has been closely aligned with the state authorities in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target audience where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional leader .
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with adol@@ escents , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is to appeal to people emoti@@ onally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , there were reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the deciding factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the sharp rise of right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ma@@ ël , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would not yet talk about new righ@@ tist terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups form groups that plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but it is not recogni@@ zable for a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism .
the previous groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
concerns expressed concern about the fact that many hand@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is the concern .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers have previously not been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example C@@ DU , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , which , however , radi@@ c@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ tic potenti@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Sites or World Records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous show of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ ung became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a gap of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries of well @-@ known countries .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , they wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media marked it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of wh@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it funny with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only took a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , played there no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was held responsible for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone .
fr@@ ene@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in case of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , distributed the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to give her information to an oppos@@ ing grid that partly ro@@ de on the counter@@ part .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and one emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident location on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the last travellers were brought back to the district of Pe@@ w@@ sum from a regular bus bus back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n district .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the cost per cubic meter se@@ wage is from 1 October 2016 for the field of wast@@ e@@ water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2,10 euros ; for Zul@@ u / Lin@@ denberg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( up to 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will be increased at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ samt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , we found that for these se@@ wage plants under@@ cover discoveries .
due to legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ u will have to take a deeper insight into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee , a new calculation of the charges for the se@@ wage plants of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calculation period may also be compens@@ ated .
Schmidt founded the gra@@ ving fee increases in order to handle all three se@@ wage plants with relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ e@@ water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact on the basis of the low distribution base for example .
in addition , the se@@ wage volume in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , due to their age of renovation and repair expenses , all three facilities remain in a considerable scope , not least due to their age of renovation and repair .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ denberg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the wast@@ e@@ water plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced due to a damage .
in the pump@@ ing plant Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years of old convey@@ ing systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first se@@ wage pond lo@@ wered in the pond treatment plant Lop@@ p after almost 20 years of operation , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs were to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;

stone houses made clear that the cost of operation and maintenance was &quot; fully penet@@ rating &quot; in the three plants in the three plants . &quot;
as a result , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the wast@@ e@@ water plants in the past 20 years has spar@@ ed .
according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned systems will continue to be prec@@ ari@@ ous in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ e@@ water purpose association cannot be extended by these facilities , because it is a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art facilities .
Bulgaria posted inflation for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in July on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were booked .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % compared to June 2016 , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a rise of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the pre @-@ month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and foot@@ wear ( 2.2 % ) ; Mobili@@ ar , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its fil@@ tering tool , Snap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are stun@@ ned , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies a day .
all mis@@ appropri@@ ations arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the application of Black@@ face or promoting white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sl@@ ot@@ ted , false teeth and so@@ wn che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow face . &quot;
they asked if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y had to a bigger problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The For@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to Ani@@ me characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et about the photographs were widely spread that the filter was &quot; viol@@ ating and the least unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ lo@@ wish , but that the yellow face was drawn into the throwing extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride wire .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ chat big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could rather assume sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ chat Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to ext@@ ingu@@ ish her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and a telephone interview she said that she believes that rac@@ er @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y reflects a lack of diversity in Snap@@ chat settings .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a staff responsible , focusing on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said , in turn , that she will have her Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership of fal@@ si@@ fied I@@ SIS intelligence services , establishes committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on site , an inquiry committee of the Congress det@@ ained in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Defence Council , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Military Intelligence Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Agency analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their ass@@ ess@@ ments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short of Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls America &apos;s military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence gathering information , typically sent down by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ Com range up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that governmental peaks have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as I@@ SIS or I@@ SIL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com entity publicly announced that a military reg@@ ression of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the threat of I@@ SIS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ can called the Task Force in life after it was played that analysts were worried about manipul@@ ating reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the Secretary General of the Defense Department .
democratic members of the Intelligence Agency published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com managed to create an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessment on I@@ SIL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest @-@ ranking democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , called Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mor@@ ality under analy@@ st and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive amount of room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported cases of investigations by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who were accepted after complaints by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress while the inspec@@ tions of the General In@@ spect@@ orate are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have retro@@ active effects on the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the ministry of defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the issue that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State rec@@ ol@@ le@@ ct disputes of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , dealt with the recommendations of many analysts as opposed to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to specify government agencies that contrary to the statements made by the government , the refin@@ eries against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislat@@ ure because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing in front of the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
the US winning fourth match in the ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain is pending
one day after she shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
but she knows that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch , who will lead the other group .
as always the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Ac@@ tress of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work@@ horse in London that we have now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have the ru@@ d@@ der to ro@@ am completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she accomplished a spr@@ int with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and plu@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid@@ st the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel steady and inevitable , a quick relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is handed from the br@@ acel@@ ets to swi@@ mm@@ ers to gymn@@ asts for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neigh@@ bor in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with di@@ m@@ ples , could have been among those known names that were sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ asts , or even f@@ enc@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold at the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ oline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air du@@ ster shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many who had asked , did not know that there is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline and until 2012 had made an ath@@ l@@ ete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans who share for the women .
Dong dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain out@@ sider , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a Clo@@ wn School when it sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ cing - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant tramp@@ oline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and o@@ int@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
according to the official Olympic program , they will be judged according to version , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the bas@@ eline , but also in the television transmission also another sin@@ ister goal : the one to the world or the Olympic Arch@@ ords .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the tramp@@ oline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline ing@@ finger is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly upward .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the stream around 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end of the end as part of a afternoon blo@@ c on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by att@@ acking and objective male athletes - just as the male US gymn@@ asts proposed recently - according to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .

violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia tac@@ kled the violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters have been killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police in shooting .
is Ethiopia straight to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and spread in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was mer@@ ciful .
witnesses admitted that polic@@ emen were shot and killed in dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security professionals strike young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Committee calls for an in @-@ depth investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at the resp@@ ectable pace .
his infrastructure has improved dras@@ tically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Central America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil usage to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time the tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years have been more or less constra@@ ined to exploit tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through social media as cheap smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiopia compl@@ ained that they were so protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but also this is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population , which are dominant in the military , intelligence agencies , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts said that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in taking up early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to deal with opponents and to make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime l@@ acks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ concl@@ usive reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North @-@ Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which according to statements by analysts apparently were ple@@ d@@ ged by the government and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of disturb@@ ances went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ fortun@@ es of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month of attacks in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , led by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts said that the protests hit the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its allies to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin line of atro@@ cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama have been founded I@@ SIS is &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that surro@@ unds his campaign by att@@ acking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can Republi@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensi@@ bly to the American public .
it also brings along his comrades who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to explain statements that he did not mean at all .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Tr@@ ump broke back in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created I@@ SIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said that he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a series of interviews he said the alle@@ g@@ ations were completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy I@@ SIS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism le@@ ashes down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has attempted to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling cargo values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bor@@ ed .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already taken sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July , he critic@@ ised himself when he said the Russians had to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Natur@@ ally I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ use the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even cor@@ ro@@ sive sound , as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published Friday , showed a leading edge in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries not to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps got his loyal supporters into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors of Tr@@ umps , had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was ques@@ tioned whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that in front of Obama , I@@ SIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ind banks , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed I@@ SIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump has continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked the exc@@ use of Mr. Tr@@ umps as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idential Board .
once past the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a busy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which was founded in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals involved it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York &apos;s change is , it is also new finding .
a revi@@ ved cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money medium for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ es such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ces onions .
there are natural bow@@ ls .
the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a customer .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even when they set a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and inevitably made the same .
&quot; I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not make any gru@@ dge that the soap business took the old business area .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish residents of Green@@ pointed also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he pret@@ ended to release them soon so that his new neigh@@ bors will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice @-@ local wants to fill and sell cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed in the ground than the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the ordering felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .

as g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on this day was somewhat modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Spi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Hei@@ ghts and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deals with Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ por@@ ter at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ ort snack in Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh apple sand@@ wich with olive leaves , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix@@ tures ate .
as the re@@ por@@ ter cooked min@@ ced , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cream and sav@@ ory .
they were made from an ingredient and some cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have lain in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women bo@@ iled for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paints the roads with which the country went with it , not to be the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious meals such as bread and br@@ asser@@ ole were too stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of restor@@ ing food resi@@ du@@ es , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noticed that coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which had been the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ rated luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures have been tried , because a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction existed prior to taste or even wholes@@ ome common sense .
during her research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addi@@ tive at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not suitable for each other .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists , including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , from 1923 to 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge to transform the r@@ amp like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delic@@ acies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farmer &apos;s in @-@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the milli@@ on@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a nearly gil@@ ded dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was mar@@ vel@@ ous to reality .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to re@@ mark his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the An@@ heu@@ ern of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes made by Mrs Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House gave birth to the most te@@ di@@ ous food in Washington but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the types from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law at the writing of the book - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of wast@@ ing food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the catch of the wind .
after the plate was evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled out a dessert which they had prepared at home : the p@@ fl@@ au@@ mend@@ es@@ sert , that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a bad trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no pe@@ eled cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody exchanged something rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tast@@ ed not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in Bom@@ ben &apos;s Attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung so far has saved scar@@ c@@ ely 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own lives on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to help first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian scor@@ er , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has never seen himself as a hero , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , life is saved , I think that God sees a marty@@ r in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs across the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remn@@ ants of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ y usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the ship ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms at a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ y only got offspring with 150 years .
at the same time , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the basis of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle , em@@ bos@@ sed by slo@@ wn@@ ess , seems to be a sponsor recipe for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 392 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this lifetime , which means a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist thought for a long time that Greenland will become Stein@@ alt .
only l@@ acked the evidence .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ y are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated areas of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the li@@ fest@@ y@@ les of the Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks .
their slow @-@ motion @-@ ben@@ ds were as they took six animals with a transmitter before S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
perhaps they ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and seek Kad@@ aver , who tor@@ ate from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ y , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 502 centimet@@ re size .
to determine the age of animals they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ ls of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the protein contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had remark@@ ably much carbon @-@ 14 in l@@ enti@@ l core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search for large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens @-@ nucle@@ us , which origin@@ ates from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland , while the Rekord shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers could even be 392 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature age and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ y with the multip@@ lication apparently can be at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters is not a coinci@@ dence .
also the record holder , a 211 year old Greenland W@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck a 120 year old har@@ poon point was stuck in front of Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on spar@@ es .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
for the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal influences heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants possible as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ Bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building grund in double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with topics around building , the Council of the Council has focuss@@ ed on the most recent meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with relief , the Board accepted the notification made by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven residential buildings can begin . &quot;
after the plot , par@@ cel@@ ing and opening questions were clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons were placed on survey , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) to interested parties nothing more in the way .
the municipal council is convinced that the B@@ auf@@ blas@@ chen appeal to young families and fur@@ ious sen@@ iors in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au .
as it was said , building owners can immediately announce themselves in the town hall , the public council is expected to consult the municipal council during its September meeting .
in order to also en@@ force requests for reloc@@ ation of further business enterprises , connected with the creation of work@@ places , the Council decided to change the newly created land use plan in some areas only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n the industrial estate already designated there for two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 is extended .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
therefore , the city on the Main has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies reloc@@ ated from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have so far been admitted to the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently using large US banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association counts with 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , which un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance pru@@ dence EI@@ O@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ RB .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the EC@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but also cuts down in the infrastructure of Dublin as well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
further points are the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not as easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate agents is 50 per cent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company coun@@ sel@@ ing Mer@@ cer , the city will stand in place seven , Luxemburg , in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba by the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector worked in London , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead obt@@ ains legal costs from h@@ epatitis C fil@@ thy dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs that you have ar@@ isen from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead stood after a U.S. judge covered a pattern of mis@@ behaviour on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other non @-@ ethical actions .
in case of complaint on Thursday , U.S. minister Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a decree of the cost incur@@ red during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to move with Gilead that domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck were indi@@ cted mut@@ ually and took possession of laboratory work entitled Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State once more .
the United States supported the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city abandoned it , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) com@@ prise the remn@@ ants of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city .
they released over 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Reu@@ ters Military Council of the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former minister Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster Verlag for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign hero Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts referring to his previous promises to publish his tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law on account of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ usal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons Wahl@@ kamp@@ f@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the release of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Sonder@@ berater , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before tax inspec@@ tions are not completed .
Tr@@ umps critics , among other things the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his ref@@ usal to raise questions relating to assets , his donations for charity organizations , his business and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government taxes have become an issue in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said that he had been subjected to a control test of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump got &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before vot@@ ers and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s Camp@@ aig@@ n has published tax return to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons currently living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income were related to wages , unlike most of the Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , out of which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 were tax@@ ed .

the method has proven to be effective and the honey@@ guide Foundation , who had already had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion along with the U.S. Nature Conserv@@ ation by trained volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is a pupp@@ et day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ...

a French director with Jewish roots captiv@@ ated a media rebellion , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election since it would have requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and er@@ ased ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has applied to this hotel chain in Germany is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response from the internet where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ate the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have followed the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly indicated all alle@@ g@@ ations of themselves and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the Schnell@@ wahl@@ liste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung an spokes@@ man for Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
added that the country code is now added .
police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mis@@ esch@@ utz against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
on Thursday , students met with the police in Sao Paulo , Brazilian city when they assembled to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber floors against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started when police officers tried to diver@@ t the students , which led to the police rubber @-@ fin and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ est@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the pro@@ visional President Michel Tem@@ er at walls .
the latest protests took place a few days after prot@@ esters in masses walked to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ is@@ sed by a Senate of the Senate on its vocation .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ to @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly in the country , shared the ambassador with them .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian abroad conc@@ er@@ ted approximately 35,@@ 000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia from the last year will be broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians continue to visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received monuments of ancient Persi@@ an civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; searched for : beverage brands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ br@@ öl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rob@@ ber@@ y was committed on Thursday evening on the beverage market by Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the tut@@ el@@ age of a gun @-@ monkey , three dark @-@ dressed persons , who had embrac@@ ed their faces , took the issu@@ ance of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled at first on foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
how much money has been captured , the police don &apos;t share .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 m tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly visible .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors have to be sc@@ anned after the raid towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and the gravel parking lot located opposite the Park@@ house entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car may be wing@@ ed , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have observed observations in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y of rob@@ ber@@ y should urg@@ ently report to the police .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the mercy of mercy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ ach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were ma@@ stered .
in order to bridge the period up to the next Romantic pilgrimage of all ministers in two years , the senior minist@@ erial position of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been checked and one finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where , during this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the opened Gate of Mer@@ cy at Frei@@ burger Mu@@ en@@ ster .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gre@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and hal@@ lo@@ oms , made their way in the way .
in the evening before Rev. Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and distributed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms .
from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er Lieben Frau steht and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m from Münster started .
the individual day@@ tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at night clubs , chap@@ els or churches continued to sing together to sing a song from specially created pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights the parish families of the local parish priests stood at their disposal .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller attended the stage with a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , one took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch , but at first some 500 metres altitude metres had to be lo@@ wered and then climb@@ ed again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a common bar@@ be@@ cu@@ le at the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the closing stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at Freiburg Min@@ ster in the later afternoon and ro@@ de through the gate of mercy .
God thank@@ ed God with a small impulse .
in the evening mass in Münster the Min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage destination by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service , the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ mop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste the last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen . the j@@ ump@@ ster made the legend , when he stor@@ med home to hit a victory from the favorite New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y scored the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ medals .
they repeated the trick after taking up the train world champion@@ ships in London in March , despite the res@@ ign@@ ation of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a sign .
Ho@@ ys retirement testi@@ fied a gap to close Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y prev@@ ailed and Sk@@ inner entered the quali@@ fier circuit a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ unde , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap he was almost back , but Kenn@@ y took the team to the front and Sk@@ inner stopped it .
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , when Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climb@@ ed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
in the final round , we set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , he said that after a weak start he dropped off on the track .
he later returned this statement and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels with all the UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ ys it &apos;s in the area of possible that he won Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23rd ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ stic competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the finish .
the World Record , who won gold in London 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had fought yesterday with delegates before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding Women &apos;s Competition , which continues and ended tomorrow , Laura Des@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB Team relies on his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a pair of medals to medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April amid Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ wür@@ fen as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to lifting the energy demand question@@ able
the future of the al@@ ign@@ ments of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand on the game as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus aboli@@ sh all supply contracts as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closure .
in addition , it could lead to domin@@ oes , as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum mel@@ t@@ sheet with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging businesses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should enter into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L recei@@ pts from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong market prices for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the Tre@@ aties in the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expect@@ ancy of a dism@@ iss@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to excl@@ ude the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to ensure power supply to melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it signed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and tom@@ ago about 900 MW of electricity .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Antonio is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
Leon J@@ enner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to we@@ eping , &quot; wrote Leon .
the cover of the cover followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) , descrip@@ tive reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ biz un@@ cle and producer of keeping up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , ending with a classic turn : they all have planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ e@@ beha@@ ved action on almost every birthday stage of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a radio station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate in this public@@ ity .
with a view to the September edition of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on show in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for herself .
the September edition is for Vo@@ gue , the most popular edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles a picture tape than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the model 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the disclosure of his cover stars is so long@@ ingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the Bul@@ letin le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate M@@ oss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; model@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of its generation - falls under the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything is applied to J@@ enner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers doesn &apos;t like success to everyone .
with its reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat stra@@ ined .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues critic@@ ised Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the mist@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these emotions bo@@ iled up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but fli@@ pping on the wrong seems to pass by the point .
Leon J@@ enner is on cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her pictures of Cin@@ dy CRA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal law centres represent 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid posts are reported annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and similar - have been rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ dated , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose further 30 percent of its federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell &apos;s Research Centr@@ es said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Development Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been dism@@ is@@ sed every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without an aboli@@ tion of the decision of the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal law centres are chronic under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need will be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave non@@ violent relationships , people with insur@@ mount@@ able and overwhelming debts , families who have been dism@@ is@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dism@@ is@@ sed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General Ac@@ count@@ ant and Federal Minister of Defense and Sen@@ ator of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these mi@@ tig@@ ations so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal utility centers and their customers &quot; communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Wahl@@ kamp@@ agne indi@@ cted after collabor@@ ating allegedly gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been charged for alleged in@@ action after it has been reported that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February had directed a gun to a staff while travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday by Charlotte Bord@@ ini Regional Court , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini had been waiting for months to have waited for the matter internally , before realis@@ ing that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ ehle , &quot; Bord@@ ini stated in his indictment .
having compl@@ ained about the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini stipul@@ ated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to make damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dissolved a revol@@ t when he said a crowd of people in North Carolina , that the Second Am@@ end@@ ment people &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton is elected and judges should ap@@ point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign revealed that the media would have torn its words out of the context and that it would not rise to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of the duty of care and of Philip for bodily injury and lasting mental damage .
the press spokes@@ man Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ CC@@ B , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
on calls with his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and C@@ DU lose
during the upcoming elections in the federal states Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the governing party SPD and C@@ DU are distinguished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could barely go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good chances to continue the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collap@@ sed from 35.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only blo@@ ws just ahead of the C@@ DU , which could come back to 23 percent again .
the third place is disp@@ uted between the left and the Af@@ D .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) fell back into the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Parliament with 3 percent each .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the C@@ DU reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Af@@ D would be represented at the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would like to miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched .
the followers today domin@@ ate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half kilo@@ grams and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not well in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was at first eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would range today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with a minimum of 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months before at the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair in Hannover as an &quot; office in Western pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could send and receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , even if tor@@ mented slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
the price was rather proud of the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile savings of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled to Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates suppliers who came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is everyday for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the units are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications markets .
in the meantime , a whole industry was created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , easy to use via touch screen .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , still today , the iPhone is the main product of the company .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the following .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to leave the smartphone even time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , it represented the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are already providing 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be fl@@ aming at the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had no injus@@ tice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in a funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and in the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented run@@ ways in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; for ad block@@ age
for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent advertising blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding on its adverti@@ sements in order to make it more difficult to detect the display of indicating the part of the site advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ gger , Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ und @-@ Her @-@ battle between the anti @-@ acting Open Source Community and the re@@ viewers has been in progress since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the fight for social media is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
with 1,@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the company &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company has set it on ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ person .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenue , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as re@@ warding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad prize pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their adverti@@ sements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not adverti@@ sements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ person in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we focus on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control over people &apos;s hands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who is supposed to commit suicide on Swiss motorway &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police force witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was handed over to a presum@@ able suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , which was passed over by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been ques@@ tioned , but some have still not been identified , the police , who invited them as well as every witness of the incident to report themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran on the free@@ way - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ e@@ woman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent kill@@ ings after having crossed a man and killed a man lying near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become un@@ conscious on the street .
the court stated that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ e@@ eable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 .
NA@@ SA Climate @-@ model : Venus was once inhabit@@ able
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model Venus was probably inhabited .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies , NA@@ SA developed a model to detect the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have had similar conditions .
scientists previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that the Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still revol@@ ved slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS modelling simulation , the slow turning of the Venus ex@@ pon@@ ts its day@@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , resem@@ bling evolution that was previously thought of by planetary scientists .
although it once was suppos@@ edly inhabit@@ able , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ exposed to a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide escap@@ es with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the findings of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy steps back as coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as coach and vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low right of co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best coach in the League during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference back five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal &apos;s Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ el@@ workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; res@@ ume talks , put strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the struggles for wages for North Sea workers are exposed , while all the parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea running through Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we agreed to re @-@ start the process of the current strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut the rates to its counter@@ trac@@ tors in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the required space to come through the market decline .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ acity with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which has intensi@@ fied by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea in comparison with an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ traum@@ teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ er understand why stars are rotating in star clu@@ sters at different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the planet formation .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the compar@@ isons of our results with other star clu@@ sters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster , which were originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now going to turn the fastest .
at peak rates , these str@@ apping stars exp@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate starts to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower tracks than smaller ones .
&quot; at the Ballet of Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much ahead of us about what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the press rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star occurs
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez more quickly than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on 12 August against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Parti@@ cip@@ ant of the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract signed 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary .
as a player it paid Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es several mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eb@@ all players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the retirement Hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was arrested for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to his involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main susp@@ ect to have received performance @-@ promoting funds for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the le@@ ague could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ are@@ well days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job includes an attempt to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the ac@@ tress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with pop star Madonna and ac@@ tress Kate Hudson said , sympathy @-@ acquain@@ t@@ ances of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ val of Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez @-@ Team .

Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a poll@@ uted ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known to the Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - just before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the un@@ fair .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the CAS confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m butter@@ fly , only about 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have taken part in the prec@@ urs@@ or more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) requested the opening of the B @-@ Probe and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Xin@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Justice Tribunal for CAS and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the I@@ OC is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS is responsible for the san@@ ction of the sports@@ men with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova le@@ ak@@ ened , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic rider . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance should act for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended in advance , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should already be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported criticism of the bul@@ let@@ ins .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg and his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had a positive test for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on for three days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both deny the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another severe blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming sport , the former clubs in China also caused violent con@@ front@@ ations between the athletes .
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun stood at the centre of a con@@ frontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been positively tested by the Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock .

program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently target@@ ing targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ran@@ som required by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the sight@@ ings of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to gain a ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rat@@ ors discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
only private users were the goal , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ bly fast over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for more recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als permanently .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ smith .
to get the end turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
however , where in private users the personal photo database is at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stopp@@ ages .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation , in case of a case , people were in danger of life .
several hospitals had already been victims of attacks in Germany , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in the face of stand@@ still .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user @-@ conquest areas and the contact with the black@@ heads and come to the result : the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they declare their sacrifices by chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files .
and if private individuals rede@@ em payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit tot@@ als to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from antivirus @-@ provider SOPH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that it is three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ant software in the form of a software modular to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits have been created by installing malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers then look for further h@@ ackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log@@ g in one of the forums on the underground , buy the set of a criminal and instru@@ ct another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per authentic@@ ated computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the crimin@@ als enter Sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that ensure that their data is better secured .
over 50 percent of the companies &apos; IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on delivering ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors instead thre@@ aten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could in future take completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the hacker Conference Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could definitely be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then block a whole production line in a factory rather than heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pé and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
the materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit top is falling down there .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
it is not only a trunk of 453 l for high @-@ featured and 10@@ 26 l in revers@@ ed back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ ols and thus offer storage space , which is height from the floor to ceiling height of 1.@@ 24 m .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the steering might be a bit more direct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the Top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to tempo 32 ) , the colli@@ sion warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colli@@ sion war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he rated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the smart Tem@@ por@@ ator respon@@ ds to traffic sign recognition and reduces the speed when needed .
but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch tou@@ ch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the roughly 2@@ 9000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : crash on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is only concei@@ vable with dangers which are typical of aviation , the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court argued ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened all over - it is a common risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
event : when paid by the organizer
after their trip , ill travellers only get money back if the cause of the disease can be found without a doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have reported the same symptoms .
in the case of a negoti@@ ated case , a family was severely affected by di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their condition caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective se@@ wage treatment , which was supposed to contam@@ inate sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip had been poor with it - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
although the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs shortly before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not hurt his information obligations , so the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the overall risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
after the violent acts of violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about other attacks .
the state had to calm and act decisi@@ vely at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of perpet@@ rat@@ ors with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders have to leave the country faster , this increases the security and strength also the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to implement the proposals until the parliamentary election in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel recru@@ itment of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ four mag@@ nit@@ ude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is to be improved to am@@ end the right to arms so that it is especially difficult to buy weapons on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed sweat @-@ duty for doctors should be maintained after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ c@@ alization of refugees , the minister maintains a better social care .
teachers must be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .

&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the C@@ DU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general prohibition of full @-@ conce@@ al@@ ment is proble@@ matic for constitutional law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot prohi@@ bit all that one re@@ jects , and I reject the bur@@ dens of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green boss Simone Peter rejected the minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate with always new anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of explo@@ sives and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway fe@@ eder
it takes a regular look at the Um@@ geh@@ ungs@@ straße - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic when they drive via the motorway exit Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road building will extend the road between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Straße , the right turn @-@ off track by 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer Street on the right .
the major advantage : the transport spl@@ its early on , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the C@@ DU faction in the District Council of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder nerves the mot@@ orists in particular between 17 and 19 h .
on week@@ days the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also goes beyond .
reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here traffic is only lo@@ wered single @-@ lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt in a well @-@ in @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity to record the heavy load traffic in particular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will last , the responsible country can &apos;t say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but with years to expect : the bridge has an official remaining period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the national company deliberately chose the we@@ aker time in the school holidays because with disabilities it is to be expected .
traffic will be passed on on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intercultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years attended the production in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the young@@ sters of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video anim@@ ations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , you@@ ths with and without escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will receive the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas singing , dancing , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical teaching are in the planning .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; project goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased refugee figures , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star sn@@ out Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke made by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle , the Chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see many star@@ fish in the sky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ schu@@ ppen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is Persi@@ an , which includes 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star@@ bases . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening you are tos@@ sed forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep a long way before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , it is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders speak ?
there are several types of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , Member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ schung and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore a single and dor@@ man@@ t disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through sleep &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; affects many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors require one another .
who , for example , has a disc @-@ disk @-@ case , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and wor@@ ries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I become a doctor with in@@ som@@ nia ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ eß .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , exhausted , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleep trouble , it is important to find out whose causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there are scar@@ c@@ ely lo@@ wered dor@@ mit@@ ories in Germany , acc@@ entu@@ ated by Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first contact the family doctor , advis@@ es We@@ eß .
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep lab , physicians are advised for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory infections , in case of path@@ ological day fatigue , in sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze says .
one does not have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after c@@ abling you go to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger .
in addition , a camera shows sleeping on the ceiling .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws in which you can set for a better sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ eß counts on : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , avoid alcohol , and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on right away , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to have
former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cut of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the Doh@@ a World Championships and at the same time presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook protected his ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20.000 € and a jungle King &apos;s 150@@ .000 € nobody should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good .
this means that we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote very much and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .

airport : ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Al@@ lowed
professional slide at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 was able to mar@@ vel at the Düsseldorf police station .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage theft as a gang .
at 21 : 30 , civil servants recognized a gang in the area of the Düsseldorf airport , known as the polic@@ eman from past theft .
since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acies .
the specialists of the Krimin@@ al@@ kom@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts specifically for the enforcement of criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
in doing so , they had collected over 15,@@ 000 euros in total .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between , still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stone streets : the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem so at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly @-@ painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
facing a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demoli@@ shed , will be built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , is illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior Sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has repeatedly argued for a hard action against the project , the area as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ett @-@ gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ ths , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the building workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers went down under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ garten .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many local residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jana * , who brings up three children here , is gener@@ alized above all by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the concern before rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted a majority police protection from the v@@ and@@ alising left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police come up between house occup@@ ants and their neigh@@ bors , apparently doesn &apos;t exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which has a low average income as compared with the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including nearly all of the Main@@ zer Straße close to Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are partly still inhabited by the people who had been occup@@ ying them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tor@@ ers from all over the world : now residents of East Germany and former hous@@ eb@@ rail@@ ers share their Kie@@ z with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they are recogni@@ zable by str@@ anded slices or freshly painted faç@@ ades that were disc@@ ar@@ ded with paint @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often as in the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like bodily injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ enses make property damage , which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a ten@@ ement house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is more important : the people in 94 are their neigh@@ bors , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars will no longer give it any longer in Riga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drag@@ ged into the Riga street - and has remained .
that is why it was so important that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to take away : by un@@ folding new buildings in former buildings displac@@ ed by the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well bet@@ tered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely do not know violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never stops ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ inees who anno@@ y themselves about color bombs : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub neighborhood , can compl@@ ain about noise there .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of managing Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group signi@@ fies that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ imposed wo@@ ollen au , which is above all a problem .
for example , some - less mo@@ cking than rather focused on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an en@@ ig@@ matic wool @-@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine said that Anni@@ ka supports Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ our@@ ing and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
new containers are coming soon at W@@ as@@ enst@@ raße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been acknowledged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection of the connection .
they need to put the refugees in their own or rented apartments .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ samt to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private homes .
it doesn &apos;t work so far , unless you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will soon be installed in the W@@ as@@ enst@@ raße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports .
many work in the building yard or help house master@@ pieces , do a non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity not only means work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people need to develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs offers like sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here is the administration and community of volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can &apos;t bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach should not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
however , there is also problem inci@@ dents , &quot; said customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing is at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do they have fear of radi@@ c@@ alisation after recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer says clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what many people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a risk of resi@@ dual risk and if it does not want to excl@@ ude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins kill them completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honor@@ ary community must look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they have always in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this question is clear to answer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the policy is shy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually it is un@@ fair to place them on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not yet arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine Customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already been able to integrate the existing people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ sting with helicop@@ ters
the helicop@@ ter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were for@@ ci@@ bly penet@@ rated to an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ dings in the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.70 m tall , probably m@@ asked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis .
they fled in the direction of the city centre .
the police used several strikes as well as a police helicop@@ ter .
the flag went without success .
perhaps the unknown ones fell near the apartment or at their escape .
