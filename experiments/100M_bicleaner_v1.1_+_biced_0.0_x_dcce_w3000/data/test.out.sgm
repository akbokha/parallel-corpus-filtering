<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistants have called upon their union to approve new work campaigns in their dispute regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for its entire Council to approve more work combat activities from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that it would have given ministers to deal with the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, Assists and Medical Students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members, which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was "persistently quiet" to problems, which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said:" "" "considering this, the JDC Executive Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and solicited official new negotiations for all your concerns." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">As an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BMA Council, in order to approve a running programme of escalating labour campaigns starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the fact that assistants were struck by six times this year, the first total cases in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistants Dr. Johann Malawana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was smallible and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved like never had happened to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin parted and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even bigger, since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the vow becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "for months the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for all.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan had benefitted his own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">08.11.2015 | Desperate Housewives</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan as he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was released last month with a failed coup d'etat almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-aisled rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian importers are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti already formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West because it looks at its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the ongoing resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pivotal to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader in Ankara won with certainty a bonus that he called for support for the elected government bodies after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep-seated fear of regiment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an analyst as it once described to me to portray an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents were saying that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey clearly avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shuts off Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk together at least again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fired Stabschef Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's closest confidant.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin allegedly ordered the dismissal Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is (in Russian) that he was later Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the Government Committee.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it's the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and Vaino recommended as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow a mysterious place.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov spent a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidors and worked as he was for Soviet intelligence, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted to be a potential president, at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to talk to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to confide for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he named Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putins's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putins had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown attended the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closing between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the whole deck ceiling is at its place and the last section of the Decks today gets a gong for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nordturmdeck situated in the expansion, we had to close the existing gap on the north or south side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the Viadukt is 222 meters long, weighs approximately 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3% upwards.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate since the tolerances on which the team were working, were tiny - on each side they only have a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and Greens think: investors should be taken more strongly in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD faction leader Christoph Bratmann writes:" "" "we agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas will in future indicate 20 percent of all flats as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the favourable apartments can also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "the major issue in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann:" "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as 20 percent of the housing as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem is Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants to toughen jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of that, as Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But still the programme does not fully stand: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate for the loss of some 1,300 favourable apartments, whose promotion will expire in the years to come?</seg>
<seg id="22">Up to the year 2020, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought off-running ties from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back into the price binding.</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments can be found there in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the Western city is again drastically increased, one removes from the goal of the so-called interference.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside for playing anymore but rather prefer to spend their leisure time, staring on screens, complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude one another.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm of course referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (later this resulted in a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest prior to the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand the servers were overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon, who are tracking with a GPS and once they have been found," "" "photographed" "" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "" "captured." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the car and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person tables every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercised 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays out Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to" "" "take" "" "30 minutes to" "" "get active from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "" "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look elly." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who drives sport regularly reduces their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close up new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also mürrische Spielcorrupt, who must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles ist auf all das immun.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunningly on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to the multi-fight title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American female Simone Biles turnt on the briquet of the women during the individual competition in the gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman winning a multi-fight title and a total of the fifth as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">She puts this success in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they have won gold and silver medals at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation badge during the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted to never have planned the future during their long road, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion in the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition, a winning streak that will last for as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina led slightly by two rotations, the picture smashed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Schwebebalken and Bodenturnen - in which Biles holds the world title.</seg>
<seg id="28">She repeated with 15,433 on the bribe beam again - and sat on the ground with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her grandchild - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book, became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team capitaine, which is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercises she threw the audience kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the nineteen-year-old tweet of the nineteen-year-old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="10">Investigators refused to expose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympics in the gymnastics and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color inspirational.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, is the Jew and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, rounds out, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they provided unexpected but masterful Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the peak of this sport, but do not look like gymnastics classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turner is an expensive sport and gymnasts come first and foremost in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents, who pay for training, set-up, travel and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of this turnout lie in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner receives their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and more accessible gymnasium training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and hispanic) and trains national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth a high-quality gymnastics offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thanking you so many young girls with varying backgrounds motivated to get their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of it suffers another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls, forming the floorings.</seg>

<seg id="11">Individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness leaves election districts flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the dismissal of a government report because of corruption from office</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was ordered from Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court court decided that Mayor Lutfur Rahman was to be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.</seg>

<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding the way out to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the older, in particular communities with Pakistan or banglesbian background.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious test of his immune system and worgereflex - by contacting some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk moved his course on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the lick of each object he used a luminometer to show himself and show us what he will let himself be.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed by The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of emptying the purge of a pull-up toilette, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he lick, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by riding through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railways to train stations to rinse heads of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was justified in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His probeak showed a luminometric rate of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric rate of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after its luminometric rate was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of Milk products valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I gerowed in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I'm not going to dock here because it is disgusting here." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of Milky Products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended with saying that we said" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asozial family left their social housing after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebiloba were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls expelled openings, wooden boards were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the home administration at Cornwall Housing said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as nice part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive typing, disputes and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have given the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the outgrown side of the municipal property, waste and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant coped to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as a delogation is always the last step taken into consideration of Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously visited us and have provided us with information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, it was assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that she will be delogging tenants who don't cling to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the Devonian police and Cornwall informed that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without complacency as well as those who have been harmed by such a behaviour," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="3">With it a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temples of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we have amber music really in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays an older Mary.</seg>
<seg id="12">She recalls with sorrow to her love with Tony, while the younger sister plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is wise, of course naïve, and very passionately.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "she is very similar to me, my Italian character, whom I have as Römerin," "" "laughs Bartoli." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his looks, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temper, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "for the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the" "" "West Side Story" "" "up-to-date:" "" "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertories went to New York, and the New York inhabitants didn't want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because more stupid than hitherto it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and country-swinging combat - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the candidates, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the countryside, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not local people, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, practical problems come: in the holidays there are helpers, posters hanging, balloons inflating, distributing flyers and counting on the end of votes, only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to go past the people once again with an election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of Koalitions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of head since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from its large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little bit with the people, just as his legendary spokesman predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise sailors have got cold feet and chancellor Angela Merkel's guilt on the flourishing of AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create the" "" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaign at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel for major manifestations; Merkel's parliamentary group lies in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony, as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame to anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU relies mostly on the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, says Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noted that on the land you are brushing the ground that it needs to be very rigorous to find a wire to the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely any in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "however, the Council of the CDU electoral fighter Kokert to his comrades is also self-revealing:" "" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: festivals, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is much on the game, Sellering has called his SPD a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just slightly ahead of AfD (19)." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD had still clearly won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, the small party with seven percent in polls, should create the leap into the Parliament." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday disaster and put their electoral campaign largely into the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="34">Otherwise, green electors go on search for domestic stimulants under the vacationers.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only at 8 o'clock, there is praise everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite jagged," Elvira Tetzlaff explains from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fee is also being paid to those responsible for the construction work, for instance when it comes to the establishment of cab rides.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has been immigrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is restored, the traffic situation in the town is relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive road through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some considerable complaints," "" "says Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlaufstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sneelanes were seeking and rather familiar with their Navi as signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were frank in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not observed, the municipality also called on the mass-vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look at the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27-R-refurbishment has led to sales revenues, everyone lets you look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "" "are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences." ""</seg>

<seg id="26">The areas along the road are most heavily shaken.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to dismiss the half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt requested a request from Göhner if there could be financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now, it also has to bear the disadvantages that arise due to the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other rural districts where such a little more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715 and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now seeing less frequently because of complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot drive, it is also somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his tribal climate returns to the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis, which has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does buy records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonesome middle aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before commenting on the commentator part to oversee him under the pseudonym Non-Allemant men's middle age with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiplied resurrection of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate sellers retain their emotions rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I go in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild, before I stop standing, keeping my hands and a bit of determining how: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by watching them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55 by Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three men of middle aged) into the Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle aged, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his sitting room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a sizable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and re-buy objects he sold when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought probably was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are true to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also notices a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and get to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually got rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional relevance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that awaken happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to be mentally engaged.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee infects a stack of records." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet stopped.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I smoother through a pile of Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of numbers: three men of middle aged) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just came here just recently and said:" "" "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who only slowly come into being.</seg>
<seg id="44">Stop, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a smaller audience than I purport.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teens and women middle aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - wild beasts of the latest synthesizer- and sexually packed pop instead of experimental jazz drils from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychic trauma can be hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shop window than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a dearded sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I pretend to mute the jeans jacket, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one most suitable for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research has yielded that the results of YouGov agree, they are disregarded, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors in reality, record shops and online searches.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They do not spend their Thursday morning with security not with the boomerang through record shops of Berwick Street and the sheets through panels, while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rises above the shoulders nothing of middle aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional shops in which persons within the camp offer goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that they have a fire and health risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer calm meetings between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Lagers, which is charitable and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the jungle lasted more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Great Britain's impressive performance at the 7-year rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side steppe, back, line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they proposed New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The massive defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji in this form would have struck a 15-man-team in best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks GBs had fun bouncing off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinis went down in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With only four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hemispherical topping of Mitchell stopped the hill from man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, jasa Veremalua lete a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the reanpfiff and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still unlearned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Sea sultry, whose fans sang, flags swung and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach to Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged themselves and GB kickte smashed in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scarce half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown raised the bucks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and therewith the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than in these games and that wants to be what you want.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke until the last, 220 hard pieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when she was a second Olympiagold in the second without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports who put such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all their 39.ite undisputed use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and it was no lifting up to the trainer, who did not know if he was diagnosed with cancer this day 30 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept interruption to a minimum if it is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents did not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, panning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called, "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not anxious to make something rabbit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stahl - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity generation are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Plant in the existing facilities of the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Agriculture Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with a competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on self-electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, the status quo of the current regulation will be largely written.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "also in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are to be subsided," "" "said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened further as the world's largest producer in China faced massive steel on the world market given the weaker domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties have effect on import steel action, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear is how sustainable the price repetition is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry leader Thyssenkrupp cautiously remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude last but also the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the steel economic union announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the quantity produced went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the teaching office she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and more vivid, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can establish and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a chorus is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so quickly out of the box in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it's about getting the sound of the voice in age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, explains it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or hearing of songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Due to lyrics and especially melody, even dementia-related people are sinking back to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is also demanded a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior choir, one can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone wanting to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning, two jets went up again, while another man was killed by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks which are typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not be related to the Islamic revolt movement or with international terrorism.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage fee will be increased at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a relevant calculation, the sewage rate in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>

<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zulu will have to take a deeper insight into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a new calculation of the charges for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers from the previous calculation period may also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the graving fee increases in order to handle all three sewage plants with relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact on the basis of the low distribution base for example.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the sewage volume in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age of renovation and repair expenses, all three facilities remain in a considerable scope, not least due to their age of renovation and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the wastewater plant Azendorf had to be replaced due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping plant Welschenkahl, the nearly 20 years of old conveying systems had to be overhauled and the first sewage pond lowered in the pond treatment plant Lopp after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play identities in such a way that borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are stunned, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All misappropriations arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the application of Blackface or promoting white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slotted, false teeth and sown cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversy had to a bigger problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The Forge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to Anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet about the photographs were widely spread that the filter was "violating and the least unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was drawn into the throwing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could rather assume sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchat Filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to extinguish her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and a telephone interview she said that she believes that racer-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in Snapchat settings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on site, an inquiry committee of the Congress detained in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Defence Council, Secret Service Committees and the Military Intelligence Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Agency analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short of Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls America's military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "presented Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in CentCom range up to the top top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that governmental peaks have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts" "" "presented the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom entity publicly announced that a military regression of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republican called the Task Force in life after it was played that analysts were worried about manipulating reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are in progress by the Secretary General of the Defense Department.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Agency published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom managed to create an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessment on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, called Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "said the morality under analyst and" "" "gave excessive amount of room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported cases of investigations by the Pentagon general inspector, who were accepted after complaints by CentCom analyst.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress while the inspections of the General Inspectorate are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have retroactive effects on the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the ministry of defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the issue that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recollect disputes of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, dealt with the recommendations of many analysts as opposed to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to specify government agencies that contrary to the statements made by the government, the refineries against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's dam, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of its overly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing in front of the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said that she could not remember that ever done.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel steady and inevitable, a quick relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is handed from the bracelets to swimmers to gymnasts for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could have been among those known names that were sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnasts, or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold at the olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air duster shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years that many who had asked, did not know that there is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had made an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a Clown School when it sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoon trembling of his never-ending bouncing - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and ointtos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic program, they will be judged according to version, level of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the baseline, but also in the television transmission also another sinister goal: the one to the world or the Olympic Archords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline ingfinger is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly upward.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the stream around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end of the end as part of a afternoon bloc on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by attacking and objective male athletes - just as the male US gymnasts proposed recently - according to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="14">According to Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at the respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central America." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil usage to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years have been more or less constrained to exploit turmoil and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media as cheap smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopia complained that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who mainly come from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population, which are dominant in the military, intelligence agencies, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts said that he was particularly well versed in taking up early signs of discontent and using special officers to deal with opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively inconclusive reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North-Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had witnessed such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which according to statements by analysts apparently were pledged by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of disturbances went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misfortunes of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month of attacks in Gondar, an amharian city, led by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts said that the protests hit the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama have been founded ISIS is "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group of Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican Republican candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings along his comrades who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to explain statements that he did not mean at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump broke back in relation to the assertion on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said that he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump told in a series of interviews he said the allegations were completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism leashes down to Mr. Trump, while he has attempted to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling cargo values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already taken sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he criticised himself when he said the Russians had to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Naturally I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defuse the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even corrosive sound, as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published Friday, showed a leading edge in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he emphasises the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps got his loyal supporters into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors of Trumps, had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that in front of Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hind banks, completely wrong, and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republicans argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump has continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" poor "" "" poor "" "" television experts who try to understand and said, "" "" You can't! "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked the excuse of Mr. Trumps as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidential Board.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-hay usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the ship ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swims at a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-hay only got offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the same time, the Greenland-shark swims along the basis of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, embossed by slowness, seems to be a sponsor recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifetime, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist thought for a long time that Greenland will become Steinalt.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-hay are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated areas of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyles of the Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion-bends were as they took six animals with a transmitter before Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and seek Kadaver, who torate from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-hay, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetre size.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals they analyzed the lentils of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the protein contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon-14 in lentil core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search for large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal of 220 centimeters, the lentil nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens-nucleus, which originates from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland, while the Rekord shark with 502 centimeters could even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-sharks only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature age and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-hay with the multiplication apparently can be at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live above all in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the record holder, a 211 year old Greenland Wal, in whose bacon at the neck a 120 year old harpoon point was stuck in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on spares.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">For the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal influences heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants possible as soon as possible," "" "explains the EvolutionsBiologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," made his anger at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were mastered.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next Romantic pilgrimage of all ministers in two years, the senior ministerial position of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been checked and one finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where, during this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the opened Gate of Mercy at Freiburger Muenster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Greol, Haigerloch, and hallooms, made their way in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before Rev. Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and distributed the Pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer Lieben Frau steht and so the Pilgrim from Münster started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual daytours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis at night clubs, chapels or churches continued to sing together to sing a song from specially created pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights the parish families of the local parish priests stood at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller attended the stage with a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after that, one took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch, but at first some 500 metres altitude metres had to be lowered and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecule at the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the closing stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis arrived at Freiburg Minster in the later afternoon and rode through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">God thanked God with a small impulse.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was time for the Breisgaumopole.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train to Horb.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raste the last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year old from Glasgow took the anchor, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen. the jumpster made the legend, when he stormed home to hit a victory from the favorite New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy scored the fifth of six Olympiagoldmedals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking up the train world championships in London in March, despite the resignation of Hoys, only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a sign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement testified a gap to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy prevailed and Skinner entered the qualifier circuit a Olympiarekord, but in the Standardrunde, the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap he was almost back, but Kenny took the team to the front and Skinner stopped it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, when Hindes went in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round, we set up a Olympiarekord and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, he said that after a weak start he dropped off on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later returned this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels with all the UK flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it's in the area of possible that he won Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheese of Hoy is the same.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will take part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this just for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="37">It was the only medallistic competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, who won gold in London 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought yesterday with delegates before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding Women's Competition, which continues and ended tomorrow, Laura Dest, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team relies on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a pair of medals to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the background, Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid Sexismus- and Mobbingvorwürfen as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the alignments of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - stand on the game as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolish all supply contracts as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland stand on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could lead to dominoes, as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-term speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminum meltsheet with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still a declaration of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>

<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to weeping," wrote Leon.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashian's like?), descriptive reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of keeping up Ryan Seacrest), ending with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the clichebehaved action on almost every birthday stage of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a radio station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>

<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on show in April 2014), but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for herself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is for Vogue, the most popular edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a picture tape than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the model 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The disclosure of his cover stars is so longingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities who" "" "modeln" "" "as" "" "models, celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-prize-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the" "" "breakthrough model" "" "of its generation - falls under the former category, it is in good company." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though everything is applied to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners doesn't like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat strained.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleagues criticised Gigi Hadid and called her "the misty of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These emotions boiled up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But flipping on the wrong seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Leon Jenner is on cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>

<seg id="9">The doubters had no injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers each question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably inhabited.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have had similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points out that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still revolved slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>

<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, resembling evolution that was previously thought of by planetary scientists.</seg>

<seg id="7">They are now going to turn the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: little Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping sample, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio cannot start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A polluted athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-obstacle-runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - just before the beginning of the already critical athletics competitions these messages come to the unfair.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old took the fourth place in the finals over 100 m butterfly, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen would have taken part in the precursor more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-Probe and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations" "", "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Justice Tribunal for CAS and will accept the judgement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of the sportsmen with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekova leakened, the 33-year-old went to the offensive itself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this is an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be nutritional supplements," "" "explained the athletic rider." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance should act for the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was suspended in advance, according to BNT, the B-sample should already be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's prime minister Bojko Borisov immediately reported criticism of the bulletins.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the sportsmen do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "" "was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg and his brother Tomasz had a positive test for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon for three days." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, however, both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, especially the case Danekova is another severe blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation IAAF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic doping, also the Läufernation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sport, the former clubs in China also caused violent confrontations between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "sun Yang pinkelt purple" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium more than 200 m Freestyle, I want to commit myself," "" "said Lacourt on the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun stood at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimulant of Trimetazidin, but only had to sit down a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the sightings of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to gain a ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmailing software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the goal, but the change to company attacks was terribly fast over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for more recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stoppages.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation, in case of a case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals had already been victims of attacks in Germany, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user-conquest areas and the contact with the blackheads and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals redeem payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must negotiate hard and pay five-digit totals to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus-provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutant software in the form of a software modular to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits have been created by installing malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then look for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logg in one of the forums on the underground, buy the set of a criminal and instruct another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per authenticated computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals enter Spammer with the spread," "" "declares Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that ensure that their data is better secured.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies' IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on delivering ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators instead threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could in future take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker Conference Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could definitely be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory rather than heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kinosols and thus offer storage space, which is height from the floor to ceiling height of 1.24 m.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you are tossed forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep a long way before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, it is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders speak?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several types of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Schlafforschung and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the insomnia, therefore a single and dormant disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the" "" "through sleep" "" "affects many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this there can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often common in depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a disc-disk-case, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pondering about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, exhausted, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep trouble, it is important to find out whose causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are scarcely lowered dormitories in Germany, accentuated by Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep lab, physicians are advised for example in snoring with respiratory infections, in case of pathological day fatigue, in sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze says.</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he took gold for the first time at the Doha World Championships and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler via Facebook protected his ex-team mates.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20.000 €and a jungle King's 150.000 €nobody should be surprised about missing medals," "" "the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page at night." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveyor system in swimming sport is bad, the doping controls, on the other hand, are very good.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't say that the controls should be stopped here," "" "he said." ""</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 was able to marvel at the Düsseldorf police station.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bags and luggage theft as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21: 30, civil servants recognized a gang in the area of the Düsseldorf airport, known as the policeman from past theft.</seg>

<seg id="7">The specialists of the Kriminalkommissariats 34 can demonstrate four acts specifically for the enforcement of criminal offences to Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, in between, still a rest of cobblestone streets: the Rīga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem so at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a newly-painted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone has sprayed on the façade of a grey house." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Facing a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, will be built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior Senator Henkel has repeatedly argued for a hard action against the project, the area as "no-go-zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadett-goldsmiths, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, the police patrolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the building workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown landowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers went down under the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects there is a primary school and kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who brings up three children here, is generalized above all by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the concern before rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wanted a majority police protection from the vandalising left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police come up between house occupants and their neighbors, apparently doesn't exist." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which has a low average income as compared with the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly all of the Mainzer Straße close to Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are partly still inhabited by the people who had been occupying them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and electorers from all over the world: now residents of East Germany and former housebrailers share their Kiez with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognizable by stranded slices or freshly painted façades that were discarded with paint-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often as in the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like bodily injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offenses make property damage, which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a tenement house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is more important: the people in 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars will no longer give it any longer in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately dragged into the Riga street - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to take away: by unfolding new buildings in former buildings displaced by the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well bettered," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely do not know violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for trainees who annoy themselves about color bombs: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub neighborhood, can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer of the working group signifies that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-imposed woollen au, which is above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less mocking than rather focused on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an enigmatic wool-milchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "Regine said that Annika supports Deuschle honouring and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are coming soon at Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been acknowledged." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to put the refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work so far, unless you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings must be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masterpieces, do a non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity not only means work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers like sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here is the administration and community of volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can't bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach should not work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, there is also problem incidents, "said customer honestly," people with whom nothing is at all. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they have fear of radicalisation after recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine's customer says clearly," "" "what many people may call naive." "" "a risk of residual risk and if it does not want to exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins kill them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary community must look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "this question is clear to answer," "" "the policy is shy." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Customer also makes clear that the Urbacher have already been able to integrate the existing people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
