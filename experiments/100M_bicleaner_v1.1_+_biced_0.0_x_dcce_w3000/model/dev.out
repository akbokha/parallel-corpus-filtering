Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington den@@ oun@@ ces the ongoing settlement of Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal raised by Obama to the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ orate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu was held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly considered as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election imp@@ ending in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his home .
Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ce and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where he was shot and killed by the police a popular professor of history , eth@@ ane Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call some@@ time later .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ce died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to proble@@ matic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic way to employment as a Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found the Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he did his doct@@ orate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him intellig@@ ently , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were mol@@ ten up when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson city of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that ad@@ joins a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ce when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ls Night in the night 5th of September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clean up and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , initiated the first semester seminar programme and speci@@ alizes in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including tut@@ ors , staff , students and members of the church at a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wa@@ che , while the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss@@ fully described his wife , but there is no indication that they have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for Christmas time
toys R Us says that it will not be so many Christmas season collabor@@ ators as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give up the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it was planning to hire 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 work forces were employed in the 2014 Christmas season .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business moves closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equi@@ p shops with employees selling , selling and delivering products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre wait for the roy@@ als and I realize that the seat is empty beside me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wn and a length of arm of it , with the princ@@ ess of Wales at a date .
&quot; Back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the biggest time travel film ever h@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Back in Time &quot; will be featured on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the conflict almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN boss again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a breakdown .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks during surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some start asking seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate w@@ aging .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump probably will win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ size that at that time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , no one won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b B@@ ush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps through@@ put and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey figures indicating that Immobilien @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
b@@ umps of popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa stated last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if any Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans don &apos;t see b@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers who are rep@@ enting to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first elec@@ toral state of the nation , the federal state Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
if they expose their scholars , republi@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination compared to just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nonetheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers visit Tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is almost everybody .
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to the leadership of Tr@@ umps , while Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump harv@@ ests the majority support .
before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , he scored 14 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly established their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say never to change the opinion .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they con@@ form with tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign in Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , immigration was a turning point in public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will keep det@@ rac@@ ted His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday 6 out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they con@@ form with tr@@ ump on questions of immigration .
so long as immigration is left in the spot@@ light , it will appear to Donald Tr@@ ump also .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son there is now about half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ by@@ weg path is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street a square meter of a roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meters in vibr@@ ational heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , noted .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hits by Thomas Müller paved the way to the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have created a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the witch vessel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick game in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol matches ( 89@@ . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth round of the starter in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller was rewarded with his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s lead @-@ ai@@ ded mi@@ tig@@ ation by Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a f@@ lange @-@ roof@@ ed shot of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept a word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his last six home games in the top class , including against rep@@ utable clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , we stum@@ bled upon Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els defeated by Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but with their offensive endeav@@ ors , they were often too imagin@@ ative to work .
the attacks were often initiated by game shift to left outside Douglas Costa , which rarely went through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k sm@@ ashed out of the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7. minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct sampling , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35@@ . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians were ac@@ custom@@ ed to their ac@@ custom@@ ed game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus pin@@ ched needle @-@ pins .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
so for example , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te pul@@ ls ( 56@@ . ) .
in front of New he guar@@ ded a qu@@ ail with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ vor@@ stand Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the attached Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience blo@@ c evi@@ dently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fans were injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : if zi@@ pped , the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is based on the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to keep the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists had seen more than 23,@@ 000 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ ums , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent g@@ um infections in smo@@ kers .
not clari@@ fied whether smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment falls back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained study director H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health to high age .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter remn@@ ants of the Sp@@ ät@@ anti@@ ke at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne
for the repeated time on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne archaeological findings have been made .
near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum Skel@@ ette and remains of historic buildings excav@@ ated , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is constantly being added to the Museum of Arch@@ ae@@ ological Land@@ scape Conserv@@ ation .
in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were now fifth .
from text documents had already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to remn@@ ants of the fortress and the church , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning equ@@ ates considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish is propos@@ ing the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP should develop the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are fores@@ e@@ eable that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ g@@ ments .
until now , the proceedings were agreed with each other on arbit@@ rat@@ ors , an obj@@ ection to their jud@@ g@@ ments did not exist .
in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens were not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , they want to work towards an International Investment Court according to their own specifications .
there could then also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justi@@ fication that the company can le@@ verage the tax pay@@ er to le@@ verage national laws or to impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate .
it was particularly critici@@ zed that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included essential points in the reform that the Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could thus be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when discussions about the T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , continued on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement was to stand at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the ti@@ mid@@ ly acting tor@@ to@@ sis recorded the picturesque U.S. state Michigan with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is nearly seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonder@@ fully creative Irish .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of late six@@ ties , but can drift into great op@@ ul@@ ent at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ aving series : each of the 50 US states should be st@@ amped in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live meet him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Abra@@ oise &quot; ) is published in 2005 a nation@@ wide ac@@ claimed master@@ piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ l@@ apping ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album climb@@ s into the American Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
according to extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic assemblies .
this six regular studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programm@@ able sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ foreh@@ ead @-@ bands and large @-@ fluor@@ escent stage @-@ co@@ ils .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ headed band through Germany .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly becoming St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the wide @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only for an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens would like to be modest , plays acoustic only a few older songs and finally bo@@ ils under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s faction is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s faction and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set up the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , prob@@ ing that his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several title pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve top team in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns and they called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported it as leaders .
the British correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour , &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to cut the limit of £ 26@@ .000 to 23,@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is a T@@ ory boss in the last decade about the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another politi@@ cian , says that he has &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s fac@@ tions are too con@@ front@@ ational , and that he will ref@@ rain from &quot; pun@@ ish@@ ness &quot; and the strike with resistance , and instead he has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally grab the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the property , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s fac@@ tions . but a few years later he admitted he failed in it .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and required far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds increases due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound cre@@ pt out according to data that indicate an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , income without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and generated ass@@ ess@@ ments of the time of interest increase .
the pound increased by more than 1 % vis @-@ à @-@ vis the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climb@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquired supply of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
bur@@ berry stocks were slightly higher following encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
securities of Gl@@ enc@@ ore increased by 5 % after the mining giant said he had taken 2.5 billion $ through a share sale as part of his strategy of reducing debt .
the stocks of the packaging and paper@@ group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
JD Cosme@@ tics increased by 3.1 % after the sports clo@@ aking company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of JD Cosme@@ tics says higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labour costs with his company , he says .
the cost could be the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ poster brings Leb@@ anese to the potato @-@ don@@ er @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both - and in the potato @-@ twe@@ eter , which was developed by Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ach owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together a sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with an Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then he has a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer in his store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea of the Leb@@ anese can now be registered at the patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as utility model according to the authority .
how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y therefore does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thinks . &quot; &quot; &quot;

met@@ amor@@ pho@@ sis starts the soil stabili@@ zation campaign to combat aging
Met@@ cash seeks to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash launched a soil spin campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
I@@ GA distributors and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes rehear@@ s@@ als in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash publish@@ es further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler is carrying out its annual investment strategy day for food , alcohol and equipment .
there is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di is cut off about five per cent of the food market in these two countries after opening its first markets and dispos@@ ing of all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food business and the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash about 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan came out that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase sales in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2012 IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which accounts for about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the decline in operating debt with simultaneous pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , ref@@ uses to invest more than $ 150 million to pay sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by growing fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading @-@ renovation programmes are to be placed on ver@@ ve and hopes that the wholesale merchant will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi co@@ co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short@@ est storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ i and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special Ks , &quot; came into the li@@ mel@@ ight by the in@@ famous con@@ frontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying session in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison going out : &quot; WA@@ W@@ RIN@@ KA had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , and I was supposed to beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f qu@@ aked a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am rather jeal@@ ous about is the fact that , in my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi has gone a little into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a bat when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a r@@ ack@@ et of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated slightly too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he is a very sturdy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take C@@ yrene , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long term . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has done very quickly to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the cri@@ tique he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to go illeg@@ ally to the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos was followed by the border when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with revol@@ t .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land stre@@ ak on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations climb@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicop@@ ter we@@ aves above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some reported from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations block in a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit from the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not set its hopes for a swi@@ ft action of Brussels or its neigh@@ bors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency level launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that his country also plane the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison servers were deployed during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly contradi@@ cts other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage to the 4 meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also establish higher sentences for jud@@ ging traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , expected next week , but re@@ por@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ or for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come here by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custo@@ dy and are accused of off@@ ending criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian civil servants included two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos envel@@ op@@ ed the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and hit a crowd to sque@@ eze there .
about 20 were able to come in , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
Wahl @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s Lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a double @-@ digit jump in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic vot@@ ers in primary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second at 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced , whether he is candidates for the Pres@@ idential mandate , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ elections .
more than five months before the start of the primar@@ ies , most democratic vot@@ ers say it is too early to say that their opinion stands for which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have reduced .
your support in the men has fallen sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has gone ast@@ ray , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit jump in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies say that they would support Clinton enthusias@@ tically if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support them six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are bl@@ ended with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of democratic vot@@ ers say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ vin@@ ity are also cited .
as the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the balance , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the elections would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
when democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
von Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s advantage is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chosen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about vot@@ ers .
like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers is un@@ acceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty in the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say it is about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
democratic vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies generally look for Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will continue to be placed as an external minister during office hours , most democr@@ acies are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are now un@@ happy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this remains a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .

Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good grades in leadership .

Ben Car@@ son moves up close to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nation@@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ pol@@ l conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son is well received by demo@@ graphic groups and tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gou@@ ver@@ neur John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gou@@ ver@@ neur Scott Walker , who has enjoyed the deepest fall of 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are located 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support from the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also clearly showed Tr@@ ump before Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son asc@@ ended last week Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ques@@ tioning her faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find warm water .
a Bad in Nord@@ - or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees Celsius has the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea during this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea , at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings bur@@ dened
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ kan@@ oid ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood interven@@ ed in Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introdu@@ ctory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , distributed the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and had been attacked repeatedly as he tried to reach a destination over a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the call number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and suppos@@ edly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes , to send his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said leader Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said President Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated using bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ari@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold these to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their belonging to the local community .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a interest increase comes , and the house @-@ se will get into the wa@@ ist , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the exp@@ ir@@ ation process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ si@@ veness in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial markets react .
hence , representatives of the Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could find , however , that the whole excitement was probably exagger@@ ated because of an interest increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal elev@@ ations , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here , a look at historic trends is based on how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to cut down assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in upward trend - approximately 14 per cent - on the way to interest rate , fairly flat in the last six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return over the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases they often promote .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
most notable is that the gross domestic product near its lowest point will be at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the rate of 118 interest rates since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year to an interest increase of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade show only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increase cycles from 1950 up to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in BI@@ P and submitted before rec@@ essions very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
fixed income was also volati@@ le because the market anticip@@ ates interest rate , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increases cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bond issues and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bond issues often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
Jones estimates that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stri@@ c@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , lending sp@@ ans have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed has shar@@ pen@@ ed its strategy .
large and large companies will benefit from the greater part of their business operations in the US , benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , since an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed by 5 percentage points according to each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity with their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure stock markets , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
as@@ parag@@ us could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Member of Parliament , Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conserv@@ atives critic@@ ised the sender because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they were only im@@ it@@ ating The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the program The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that it does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishes from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples of which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Manager rejected the alle@@ g@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals if it comes to the public &apos;s live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work to engage the audience than did this in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports was put under fire to push the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media at an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it star@@ ed next time an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to excl@@ ude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or give money to the fee pay@@ er for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at the slo@@ west and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that Black Friday has slo@@ wed down the issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales catalog &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to buy purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decre@@ asing revenue .
experts believe buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium study found out that £ 5 million spent spending a little more than £ 1 online .
with some products such as TV@@ s and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried those killed in Mec@@ ca during a crane accident - B@@ in Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in the first places in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia , in part , lays down the collapse of the gigantic Saudi B@@ in Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 39@@ 4 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
gri@@ eving filled , largely dressed in white , the track to avoid their respect when the first of the dead occurred their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em cemetery .
the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession passed in the Holy Place , where only days before , a building crane was cr@@ ushed through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi king hung over the construction company of the B@@ in Laden , because of the disaster , which also left 39@@ 4 injured , a san@@ ction .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beg@@ gar@@ s killed when a crane crashed through the Large central mos@@ que Mek@@ ka , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man said , the B@@ in Laden Group could not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the B@@ in Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that fell into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month .
the B@@ in Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal decree also ad@@ min@@ ed the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the B@@ in Laden Group .
the B@@ in Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over larger projects .
the late leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of inexpensive East European crafts@@ men is over
British employ more and more crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has raised a rise in
this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are target@@ ing arti@@ sans .
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q stores nation@@ wide close
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that the British laid down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men who carry out work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , these days seem to be a minority .
because British are increasingly busy making DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services on deep prices , is now out@@ dated .
so King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that focus on crafts@@ men and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop are taken by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households who make more refur@@ bish@@ ments than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there &apos;s still a majority of men in our stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients are composed of women with 80 percent of the decisions on purchasing articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British at the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also transformed their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in management positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 % of the team with women , including its management and financial progress .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group re@@ marked the costs of closing the shops .
due to the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up to 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / Do@@ b due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball vice @-@ runner A@@ ich / Do@@ b have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and spending .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with am@@ t@@ mic use .
from this accus@@ ation , he has been acqu@@ itted in court in May .
the current process has been ch@@ ased out .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were mon@@ ies of club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at about 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also charged with financial statements .
this fact divided the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ats , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represented that at no time an asset belonged to the association .
the sports @-@ revolution@@ aries had only charged allowance of expenses and the sports club , for whom they had invested a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 , and in 2001 , the Passi@@ va entered around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we go further or shut down the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the accused , in the office of the bakery , told the financial district of the financial office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to secure our life insurance as safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money ; only no debt can be made .
furthermore , in case of corresponding financial success , rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement of the compensation claims had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expenses allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was paid on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump and non @-@ detail ab@@ brevi@@ ations appeared , the former chairman described the proceedings .
the accounts and econom@@ ists shared the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant .
why the pay@@ outs didn &apos;t have been disclosed to the club in detail asked the judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial accounting , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigation for office use , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were rep@@ ay@@ ments , declar@@ ing the def@@ endants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
then he finally said , he thought that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , justified himself of the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this wire transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation in@@ dem@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why in@@ dem@@ nity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first def@@ endant explained that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never been a joke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With that you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he has never referred to a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort had been much higher , he added .
the def@@ endants were not able to demonstrate exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer stored after an audit , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter was also related to the second def@@ endant .
all the dwell@@ ings are in cash , and he said in his statement from his hom@@ etown of international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard dates further 30,000 jobs
in addition to personnel mining ongoing for three years , the computer giant will be building additional jobs at the spl@@ itting of the company .
the sub@@ missions for the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to reduce the reduction of 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division .
as a result , costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are expected to be saved on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for three years has not been completed yet .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : forced break of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part in the Ser@@ b border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water thro@@ wers against several hundred refugees .

40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials .

time of decision on interest rates for US central bank
the world is watching when the US emergency tank comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether the interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to continue longer and interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent will last .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on N@@ ULL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alising the interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less severe outlook on global conditions .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death Gu@@ ards at Delta State University &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left for compensation &quot; &quot; &quot;
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; p@@ ity &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could do it wrong , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called emergency telephone number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that police officers needed to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb recorded 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ce also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who stated that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ls had a daughter , 19 is , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ce was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ce worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ now@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb has called relatives at a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb ri@@ pped his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doct@@ orate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his way of life on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization .
150 of the around 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .

Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the re@@ orientation is an earnings contribution of some 500 million euros per ann@@ um from cost and revenue sy@@ ner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
in the future Lufthansa is no longer a executive board for the passenger &apos;s business .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought to we@@ eping the left external def@@ ender and exp@@ elled him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PSV realm .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it lasts for six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one enemy .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction so that it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .

surely David Cameron is better acquainted with The Lor@@ ax ?
it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost mem@@ ori@@ ally .
unless you are David Cameron .
when asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children as it seems to be an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead presents a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to see the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a lov@@ em@@ aking interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Storm ho@@ stage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is admitted to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy h@@ ears , like the local environment by the money @-@ gre@@ edy , trees f@@ elling , Th@@ need kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the well @-@ known Lor@@ ax , a sho@@ cking , car@@ eless creature , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR mission was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax did not read for 20 times a child in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
pushing for Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re chosen for the tour in England , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series failure is not on my map .
I would not excl@@ ude an out@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .

related message : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England Test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , one would have leng@@ th@@ ened the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
when he hopefully hits further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not achieve so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question how much time a test hit gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton received the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that Britain was first suspended Jonathan Des@@ t in the Caribbean - as a ly@@ th in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a hit man I guess .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have at least the same chances as before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of making mos@@ ques in addition to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and receive four qu@@ icks , appeared , and I don &apos;t have anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a hit man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s guy from cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred rounds immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners who lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the bat@@ sman of Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all circumstances and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously ch@@ ased .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot has received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in the heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out of Britain from the EU ) could win an allowance if the economy is in a f@@ ake in 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ resolved ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which cr@@ ashes because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ age .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ ed said that some member states , as deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , like the EU it is now and not always on its own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split allow@@ ances and disturb@@ ing treaty changes that they most often do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are climbing on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wants a great Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets look at that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the long @-@ term endurance like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will be ri@@ pping out to help the Self@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ umin@@ ous the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ zone , as they did not in 1975 during the refer@@ end@@ ums inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our admission in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they may remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist who has made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ line ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his mad@@ ness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ countries , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to diver@@ t him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door .
the press never denied him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer need to waste time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I just express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ den@@ cy and the wil@@ dest fav@@ ors of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can certainly say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , aber keine Benn@@ ink &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the sevent@@ y @-@ five years when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even has stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whir@@ lpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right not to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite si@@ ege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities on N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ated to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital , they also have mis@@ leading vot@@ ers - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday of something that was called British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grund@@ satz@@ report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy foundation , &quot; on which PH@@ E established its most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic public health principle is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco Middle ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the Refer@@ ences of BAT for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the financing he was supposed to receive after reports of Philip Morris International &apos;s tobacco company , added them .
the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session also took part in PH@@ E &apos;s tobacco line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions in the PH@@ E report will be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of PH@@ E that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were premature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addi@@ ction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ .000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ a year .
due to the clear occurrence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making publicly @-@ legal programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Direc@@ tor@@ ate General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or send , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I think is not for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am proud to see how this is supposed to be public television .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led to Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC give that again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggest@@ ing that the BBC shows like East@@ enders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C4 where one can &apos;t measure quite the audience , but they can argue , if they go to their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion pounds radio charges , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think all of us think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also announced before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and entert@@ ain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and entert@@ ain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with commercial sen@@ ders alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically altered nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure which gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
fil@@ ament@@ ous wor@@ ms usually do not respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion@@ ic channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when it applies ultr@@ as@@ ound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred into the wor@@ ms where they turn on the modified mot@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which needs to be sent to the desired location in the brain by optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass through un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ da@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the tru@@ ce fair - through a space of the ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blu@@ epr@@ ints with bright colors and animation remain stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is a del@@ aying of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area inside Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors have fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten ninet@@ een @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a residence hall , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have anger@@ ed - and on the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to dor@@ mit@@ ory halls reaches from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to say : people tell where you come from where you have Sab@@ bat@@ jahr where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not talk , even if your las@@ hes were burning and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
leave people .
people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for anyone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I &apos;ve used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ pfen : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
as you start the university at the height of the Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ate feels obliged to entert@@ ain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the cl@@ a@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say themselves to use themselves , even when they boil inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added a fl@@ ushing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people in the tru@@ est sense of speaking to the people who sit in the glass .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neigh@@ bors if it did something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .

Sem@@ i @-@ detached houses for refugees , single @-@ ext@@ end@@ able , Ger@@ ing@@ deser@@ ener
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terrac@@ ed houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only educ@@ ative mother and the ger@@ m conden@@ ser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how one can build still today still cheap and well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds row houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people stay in a large part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of the flow of refugees , we also need enough living space over the next few decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terrac@@ ed house is the solution .
guil@@ ds : a terrac@@ ed house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ ds : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without plot .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legally , I have gone through my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , it always makes the imp@@ ending d@@ amo@@ del value special construction and the placement order arrangement .
Originaltitel : GHOST Whis@@ per@@ er ( TV )
it is still sub@@ stituted , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the space missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
guil@@ ds : there were those who accused me of creating luxury homes for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do you not shar@@ pen the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true is : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but were built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford one more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also their own mother or the ger@@ m conden@@ ser .
I show how one can build still today still cheap and well .
that &apos;s what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system released when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght go back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by the lat@@ ching of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may be switched off half way and that could lead to a crash of the update .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a new district office has recently been opened .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
for years we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also no in@@ frequently many benefits of the insurance companies , because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the Sen@@ ior@@ enzentrum and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; described Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is to see both of the business leaders in the demo@@ graphic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
moreover , as under@@ lined Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the separation of the old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
thus , the social foundation creates a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment .
the office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and Saturday from 10 am to 12 pm .

Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the artist &apos;s house left an honor@@ ary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , studied M@@ ang during and after the Second World War architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann .

men in 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses to the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men therefore cried out to the young people and struck the face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the r@@ ack@@ et , he first left his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator persec@@ uted the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and went demonstr@@ atively several times there .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured left the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette .
there he was again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
under the help of a stroke , one tested on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now only a v@@ ague code description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second r@@ ack@@ et was about 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice rock breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
also there are also Sam@@ t@@ gers mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Development U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ ff mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice rock breaks on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a place in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight that years ago Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently complet@@ es their speci@@ ality training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage could fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was done , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea to practice their own practice in As@@ endorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss coming soon .
and so one agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the tw@@ o@@ fold family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , where he was appointed Chief Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is involved in an honor@@ ary position in the DR@@ K readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 onwards , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alizes in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage cans , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a doctor .
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and intensity @-@ EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) , the Müll@@ ers receive a supplement of 50,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Joint Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2000 patients come to practice in the field of rock breaks , in North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another house practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s speaking hour , by the way , continues to look in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the rock walls .
with their departure , an era ends in As@@ endorf , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sorrow they already feel after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also up@@ set on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum request can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia den@@ ies
the Croatian government had previously communicated , also Slovenia wanted to leave the refugees arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany and could possibly er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how this Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - particularly in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to cancel his borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government hur@@ ried , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to escape the registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the near corn fields .
according to the local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continually hit police vehicles with new refugees .
it was predominantly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would agree on Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government denied , however , that it was to make people wise to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it was called .
according to the media reports , a first bus arrived in the early morning with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day other buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night long from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve heard that Hungary has done so , so the police told us that we are to go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary can now come to a somewhat further west stretch .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently made a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , there are still 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the HOR@@ GOS border crossing , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings HOR@@ GOS and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic still tried to calm down on Wednesday at a local government in HOR@@ GOS : he ret@@ ains the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high refugee status at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as well as voluntary workers .
while some pedestri@@ ans spont@@ ane@@ ously interv@@ ene to chal@@ k and read the sentence for &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; to stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long &quot; , others stay short , read , say sets like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action on themselves , about life , the handling of death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical Plant of Mannheim , which is working together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband supporting the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 year @-@ old is good .
however , that not everyone wants to publicly disclose himself to the tables , be understand@@ able , finally it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death is still aff@@ licted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people are opening themselves .
an assessment of Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
die Ster@@ be@@ - und Trauer@@ beglei@@ terin ranks among the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the help of mort@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid by calling volunteers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she immediately reported and was involved in the formation in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can deal with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another waiting , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and den@@ omin@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and super@@ vis@@ ons of the death and fun@@ eral companion .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
also there can be additional personal wishes on post@@ cards .
Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lo@@ wered
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant sold its profit outlook for a whole year due to we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for holiday periods .
the share dropped by more than 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. claimed to earn a $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 70 gain in the financial year that will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the price increases , the lower views are expected to be 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ les of heavy and large packages that will be le@@ vi@@ ed in November .
the company said it nonetheless anticipated that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the holidays were announced one day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ .000 to 95@@ .000 additional labour forces , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share came to $ 31.@@ 2 per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks considered analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
over the past few years , Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which has resulted in sales in his unit express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
net sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased in freight business due to higher labour costs .
in pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists will spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the loan for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening about them at an end of the ador@@ ned , two @-@ story sitting room is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. occupation and prices here stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incen@@ tive by the near @-@ lying short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ ze the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and whether it is only a quarter of percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing what is uns@@ ett@@ ling the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the share market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strateg@@ ists alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow by promising a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Do@@ w Jones Industrial A@@ verage value j@@ umped by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that she did not fall into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition expected .
although creation of jobs slo@@ wed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.2 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation continued steadily under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of the last month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Do@@ w Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would boost global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Do@@ w is now almost 10 % below the high level of May .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predi@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically at its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed can &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded conf@@ usions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ acker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to placing an interest in interest in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its lending rate by 0.75 pp points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives did reverse these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest @-@ interest rate .
the latest turbul@@ ences do not come near this plane , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she fears a interest rate because the markets are getting up@@ set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

the kitchen ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the K@@ assen and has various participation options .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is teacher with body and soul .
she is still teaching her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ ers home at Dill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , this is completely different than at a proper school .
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande supports diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts which are painted with un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , giving babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
der Gemein@@ der@@ at Bern@@ ried authorized the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ long@@ ed gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der sports area is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent joint session , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously lo@@ wered without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the Panel had approved an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exc@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission of a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ transparent first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of planning is to use the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonder@@ fully large south @-@ roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it turned again around the roof slope , which for energetic reasons - differently than in the building plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan has no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to the roof slope - with the ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der overhead travelling generally rather restri@@ ctive with liber@@ ating orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
supplements are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Land@@ rat@@ samt for testing .
clinic Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county of Land@@ kreis , who confirmed the Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on the Supervisory Board , however , will meet on Wednesday 23 September .
should the plans be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work on the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au by fishermen and the further inside station .
the rooms are present .
the employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the altern@@ ation of the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who is to follow the follow @-@ up , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer will work with his team , when the Supervisory Board agre@@ es , both houses lead , until then next year the former hospital of the c@@ app@@ ell@@ ate , which still has 35 beds , will finally be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim is completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the super@@ visory board , contra@@ ven@@ ed rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I excl@@ ude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , Joch@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better things could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Vic@@ tims of Viol@@ ence
a crime susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to the young people and threw their cor@@ p@@ ses into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed one of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
as a susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was also considered to be the point of view and lead investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning after having arrived at home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the arrested followed the authorities in the police ques@@ tioning that the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds were killed and the cor@@ p@@ ses were placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led by the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators lay hands on him .
a decision on the immediate circumstances of the de@@ ed should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns against housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they compete with low @-@ income citizens about the last affordable housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result is a study commissioned by the alliance of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany .
there@@ with 140@@ .000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ class accommodation .
many then encounter the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to Statisti@@ sches Bundes@@ amt , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising tide of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is pushing a deficit of housing deficit , which will grow from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there were 7@@ 70@@ .000 dwell@@ ings in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ aining Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals lived in large cities not@@ with@@ standing in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ inten@@ tionally longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel M@@ om &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the lu@@ te on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new incen@@ tives should boost social housing construction again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be avoided at the Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ bs@@ gesetz ( Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ bs@@ gesetz ) and the basic tax for subsi@@ dised flats can be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , attractive tax de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation options are necessary , according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had been called on Monday evening , with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia arrange cor@@ ridor
after Hungary is practically no more transit , there are more and more refugees to choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces to go through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if necessary , we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken down to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary closed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day do practically su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to leave the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees in the morning on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot via the green border .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not exp@@ el on the border fence .
for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , barely any refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered 366 .
shortly before closing on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws regul@@ ates the over@@ coming and damage of the border count as a crime .
therefore 35 pen@@ al procedures were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed southern Hungary .
the condemned thre@@ aten sentences up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; border , including almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there .
practically no one has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees gathered .
workers started to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the gar@@ bage that tens of thousands of people left behind the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
inter@@ locking lat@@ ches were disman@@ tled and one of the recording stor@@ ages in the border region was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government figures .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing we met regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
mayor ro@@ de &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clean@@ up when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; says Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and ch@@ ased out the figures together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Middle Pass@@ au .
previously we got the un@@ hoped guests first , with snack and drinks .
we said the same thing , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was natural for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were moved to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening in Wels , in order to stop at the short notice that the railway traffic was dis@@ continued to Germany , but still to try the border .
but the regional train was stopped in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn before the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge festival with the Bavarian neigh@@ bors on Sunday soci@@ ably , days before a two bridge sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping to establish structures in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to ensure human@@ eness , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly tra@@ ded the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism .
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to establish decent conditions for conservation seek@@ ers in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,@@ 000 winter @-@ proof quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has full of hands with the refugee supp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is ac@@ custom@@ ed to his word weight .
the government used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to put quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was done without a great deal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
altogether Konrad is expecting a demand of 85@@ .000 quar@@ es in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to fulfil the number , 35,@@ 000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,@@ 000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has already held talks with the provincial officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him to create lod@@ g@@ ings for the upcoming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations also put the asylum coordin@@ ator into the ORF @-@ Aktion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels which are empty in the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of need , it could not be that neighbor@@ hoods must hold a certain height of the towel rail or size of the surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry he is more successful , Konrad is based on his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the Republic as they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
to date , the search for lod@@ g@@ ings has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment because the suffer@@ ers are currently unable to submit these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for an emergency , however , additional locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
criticism exer@@ ts the head of the city on the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday cor@@ ro@@ des further action in the refugee problem .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the return of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no more special deals with refugees to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ zeile is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in start @-@ ups of the New Wer@@ ft , and later on which to acquire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neigh@@ bors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of resi@@ dual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now gained growth in the form of another business .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where it sells among others bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses from 75 Euro onwards .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wonder@@ ed if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the big space Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has gotten e@@ erie from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I am most interested when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women get in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the specialist will not be able to answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag has enhanced each outfit .
the Br@@ ul@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called gi@@ ver .
this property also combines some with billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , sc@@ r@@ apping journalists or reve@@ aling knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office strongly boo@@ sts the election campaign .
and always cuts off .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ on@@ aire origin@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ refresh@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 population @-@ place is related to him over -@@ ump@@ y corners .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their circles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous young@@ sters , to which besides Tr@@ ump , the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also to speak - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the achievement of the family , it tends to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit like a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the surrounding area , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the gi@@ ver , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate group was the first real estate acquis@@ itions in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s finds , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contra@@ sts with the occasionally mark@@ eted statements of the desc@@ endant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican migrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die O@@ ma war ein nee Tr@@ ump , der Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement regards the American rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so up@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension wir@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mention that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ when visiting something for the church organ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that of Donald &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he does not wa@@ ver the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the say at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 children of cinem@@ as , also in the US a@@ wo@@ ke the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian village Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park was awarded the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain stei@@ ger@@ hei@@ fer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protective field .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the down@@ fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ antha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this dis@@ advantage of the down@@ fall seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise had an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to Today 3@@ 39@@ .000 .
today , today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18,@@ 000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 .
up to now Sun@@ rise stands at 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at an average of 3@@ 14,@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of the change concern these Mor@@ ning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the New Zealand coast reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics had asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show Solo without the ra@@ fters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , yiel@@ ded 4@@ 46@@ .000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Seat on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat will finally prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars , which did not manage to beat the Mc@@ Gu@@ ía show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets un@@ veiled ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly clear who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor was wrapped up in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before being three two , you might acci@@ dentally have a hint of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have laid out ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who was to receive Woods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a game cor@@ rup@@ tor who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly called both - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams &apos;s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I did it throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30@@ pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coaches Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a t@@ angle as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ts at his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a P@@ unt return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by specialist teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first game area of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a passport was leading to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al region .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the free vot@@ ers call for the recru@@ itment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ gel@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned against a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no correspon@@ dingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sunday faction of the Free Co@@ unter hun@@ ts in the Frank@@ ish Commun@@ e until Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , completely different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the Free Co@@ unter @-@ Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ v@@ anger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as did during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free elec@@ tor@@ ers as fast as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ w@@ anger also called more staff for administrative courts responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need common standards for federal states nation@@ wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s politics should not fall under the table .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the FW @-@ boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber stories on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber floors into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening at the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside of a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before it res@@ or@@ ted to rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber levels used by which are known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less mort@@ al alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern regions , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent con@@ front@@ ations since the 10th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislat@@ ors accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legislat@@ ors have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

they were waiting for appropriate offers , that is to say on the part of the city .
which investor insi@@ sts , is not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no contracts have been concluded yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the interest , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening within the urban development committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group who cau@@ tioned the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the plan is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehensi@@ bility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
fier@@ ce reactions among sea @-@ owners who came to the meeting cried out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member of the representation of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase greatly by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former inn , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donations campaign calling for $ 11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to publi@@ ci@@ ze the donation receipt on his blog .
instead of making an announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations can be doubled up to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / € 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many refugees fle@@ eing from the war broke Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight loss live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obes@@ ity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obes@@ ity sur@@ geri@@ es have proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight relative to size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery - stomach yp@@ ass and gast@@ ric tu@@ g@@ ging - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition dissolved completely and at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with this , the diabetes was completely isolated only by one percent and partially at only about two percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results of the checks of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were generally better found in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authors found out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar values over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , so the leader researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ro@@ ot@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater return in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ gone an obes@@ ity operation , approximately 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ o@@ thing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that is attrac@@ ting attention in fiction : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ attractive , meets the black of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eig@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not receive all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide urged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack on September 11 , reve@@ aling that the violent response of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used force , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four@@ fold increase in dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants through children over the last 4 years
ven@@ ison control centres in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reporting tox@@ ic@@ ation centres reported , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how adol@@ escents drinking dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young people have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ rich mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand san@@ iti@@ zer ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in inf@@ ants , a few sp@@ las@@ hes can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Tox@@ ic call centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four j@@ umps of sc@@ ented hand san@@ iti@@ zer in school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ acked her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors wo@@ ke over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
moreover , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with death cases over alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lo@@ wing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active substance .
in January three students of the fourth class in New York were planning to det@@ ox@@ i@@ fy their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the ens@@ la@@ ved plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed trans@@ disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ pole towards the round@@ about industrial area and it was too late that at the round@@ about two prec@@ eded vehicles had stopped .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ de@@ en a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , making the D@@ ons a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede about Dis@@ harmon@@ ie
there are rum@@ ours about dis@@ cord at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was spont@@ ane@@ ously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . it insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for the con@@ frontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic fighting has to fight but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against the 10 @-@ man of Aber@@ de@@ en was followed , which now stand at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic even had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we have to go on .
we really need the support from Celtic because that makes the players better .
to get together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January @-@ transfers
despite his comm@@ ent@@ aries just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he p@@ itted some January transfers , Rang@@ ers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful when signing new access and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from summer windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer will have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
CELTIC @-@ target man mich@@ u with reference guide
Sw@@ an@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract runs with the sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with an anno@@ ying ank@@ le for two years and hasn &apos;t managed the exit from Wales in this summer .
HE@@ AR@@ TS set on S@@ FA @-@ Battle because of N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 when Pat@@ erson had been sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Def@@ ender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not ques@@ tioned any integrity , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ co@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble job was assigned after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area in Edinburgh prior to a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ ms and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Donn@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but conf@@ esses that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son &apos;s trust in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys to Tra@@ b again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Donn@@ el@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Allen &apos;s happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es admitted that his team from Aber@@ de@@ en des@@ per@@ ately had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ tivity to see a seventh consecutive le@@ ague victory , giving them a margin of five points ahead of Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Allen said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in cup games or le@@ agues , which have not won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above that of the U@@ Ks , such as the numbers of the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the corn@@ erst@@ one for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am a witness of an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the United States , and as often more applications are available as places , a ma@@ ke@@ over lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will keep it emoti@@ on@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone conversations and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ain with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ por@@ ter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective , I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police ch@@ ases persu@@ aded to come from the c@@ anning river
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer , trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not get too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and take me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 cou@@ sins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish the race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt up@@ shot at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it continued .
sometimes one re@@ acts and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to walk up my head , and I want my owners to think I &apos;m trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I am doing with my license .
prior to that Moo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integration department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the RV@@ L and Bernard S@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this time and are still today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should I think it will be personal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the RV@@ L react to co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps do people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and exp@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are now thinking about it .
but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care about it , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spring fruit levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching caused him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license above the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Caviar , called the race @-@ day treatment rule &apos; ridi@@ cul@@ ous &apos; after a pack of mud or tone had been applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day , which was so .
but it also had this on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals because of asser@@ tions about Ring@@ krieg
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agenda set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of N@@ RL . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ b@@ ane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett did a barely conce@@ aled comment to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ ac of his team and said that they are concentr@@ ating on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repeatedly appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring competitions when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided the trend revers@@ al for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not ac@@ custom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this appears again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a dirty trick .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ sters was a higher result than the Bron@@ cos game against co@@ w@@ boys .
the play of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tests in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and don &apos;t have any points of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm @-@ Team has been free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bier &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with $ 200@@ ,000 deposit for drug complaint &quot; &quot; &quot;
a man who perhaps threat@@ ens a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty for his attempt to acquire 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a € 200@@ ,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ length penalty for trying to own a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200@@ ,000 in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its declar@@ ations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200@@ ,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately im@@ pover@@ ished her mother .
the police looked around and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; Web searches , which used terms for searching for un@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hog@@ g then said to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ aid in the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the At@@ tor@@ ney E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addi@@ ction - that he is ad@@ dic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was happening because he wanted to pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was tre@@ mb@@ ling and crying .
she then also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused &apos;s computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
Hog@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , in@@ decent pictures of children on June 14th last year , to have viol@@ ated the restrictions on 25 January of this year and did not appear before court to hear a hearing on March 24 this year .
defense attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked that Hog@@ g was not in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mich@@ ael shifted the judgment to October to receive background reports on social work .
Hog@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other cases pending .
it was added before the date of judgment to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up away from the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left fear of discovery and arrest the people on smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the federal police said .
since Tuesday more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn rural districts .
they were transferred to the German side by foot via bridges and shr@@ ubs .
there they are received from federal police and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Munich Central Station we met again clearly more refugees compared to the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having arrived around 700 people in the capital city alone until 8 : 00 , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : prec@@ urs@@ ors of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm o@@ ases in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful T@@ ief is the foo@@ th@@ ill of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who has sail@@ ed from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
stor@@ my stor@@ ms and stor@@ ms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , it is still possible to count on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake Con@@ stance with Bö@@ en between 60 and 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen once more .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers show their novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
2015 is especially noticeable in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28,@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ str@@ ations were attri@@ but@@ able to this segment alone in August , according to the Federal Office of Kraft@@ fahrt ( Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented this year .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is Opel Astra , which will be at dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order to sell the volume model well , the new Astra is not supposed to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in a view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is available from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is now only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the I@@ AA .
and what will be next to the new Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan weigh@@ er wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact DS 4 , which is to be seen at the I@@ AA .
outside the designers of the ed@@ len Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ ig@@ er were especially hand @-@ held at the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was primarily moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , the compact class offers a range of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the newly refurb@@ ished Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has been right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the At@@ tor@@ ney General Te@@ gel who was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells .
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court decision on a decision issued on Wednesday .
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were imprison@@ ed only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the judicial prison quarters of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s data , was now on free walk , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his official mission statement because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Jud@@ ges lifted the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for the re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
court decision now decides on the amount of compensation
even if due to legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation would be relevant , a compensation claim was given .
otherwise , &quot; a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of the compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they spoke only in April a prisoner of compensation , because he was naked in a cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ dig@@ ent accommodation in a parallel incident in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours daily in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to the head@@ lines for lack of personnel over the last few weeks .
this is why det@@ ain@@ ees are locked up again and again for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness moun@@ ts , even to fight it should have already occurred due to the ten@@ se situation .
after information of the Judi@@ ci@@ press@@ est@@ elle there are 21 places in Te@@ gel because of the lack of offspring , 19 should fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of Justice this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0,000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) are needed annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social flats come out of the rental price , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double its funding , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
a lot too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : eigh@@ ty 000 social housing per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest a boost of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and federal mini@@ stri@@ es agree that there must be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically sought after their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find jobs in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , it has given a political shift in the direction of Thr@@ än@@ hardt : from work ban for refugees for the recognition of work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence light , the asylum seek@@ ers confined to a residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the short@@ age of skilled workers - the view is mostly realised that refugees should be swi@@ ft@@ ly enabled to access the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large barrier for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often im@@ par@@ ted through personal contact .
according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the establishment of networks is the Königs@@ weg for working integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration stated that only a few sought @-@ after parents give their children to the k@@ ite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family nevertheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ ker@@ chiefs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities , for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German are prepared in the classes of welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no short@@ age , Beate St@@ ager talks about the Berlin school administration .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( C@@ DU ) but has given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees with a compensation or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application Act more if they start studying .
the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ justified &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; from 1 January 2016 onwards , this span shor@@ tens to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this funding gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually give the same rights to Islam as they have the churches and further develop the existing state churches law to a new state religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welfare organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and grant them certain control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to leave such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately left their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be a topic of the whole society much more than today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since the last decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
the same chances for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long demanded and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ r@@ acial prevention of Germany commit , must become a reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the good of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical assistance to the expected refugees , Do@@ ep@@ res@@ i @-@ President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding MAN@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end all com@@ ers immediately when regi@@ stering health cards .
provided services could later be b@@ illed with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to ab@@ dic@@ ate so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seek@@ ers law en@@ vis@@ ages .
apart from that , physicians make the language barriers especially .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse over their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
however , many refugees have also been helping with more general medical care@@ ers in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more un@@ suitable han@@ di@@ caps among refugee inf@@ ants , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ education .
with the partially other diseases German doctors would come from her education , but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the short@@ age of doctors is concerned , it may even be a relief through the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , several refugees even were doctors .
in order to be allowed to prac@@ tise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sy@@ cho@@ therapy sp@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study at the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with air@@ breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , cru@@ el@@ ty and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturb@@ ances , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to avoid that the symptoms would be chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psychological ill seek@@ ers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , however , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly cler@@ ics or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
MANNEQUINS invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to draw all age groups into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the arena on the bricks .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of man@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family for more than 33 years .
so the gift to ama@@ ze is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday reality and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stres@@ ses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welcome cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst also calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the International Cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the St@@ um@@ m@@ filme , the Cub@@ an Duo wants to take up the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and mobility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and joint unity .
balance with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
fascinating and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the post@@ ure of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read out by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mix of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo da , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are discounted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by statements by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bush .
last month they had booked and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament is ending , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , and HP stated in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused than HP is today and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage man called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to address the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver a better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of its history , his involvement in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain in the next summer .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd. has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 le@@ ague players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 that have experienced most of the vulner@@ ability days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement will last in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb against the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to give a small break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured at the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is in the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by far @-@ reaching hope to lead the club to its first European cup of Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : die Com@@ edy @-@ Show , giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now has become more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than for women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) in 2015 announced the year of the man with the goal of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality insulation predomin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the cost of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply .
and like a video player invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the football gu@@ cken in cozy arm@@ chairs and the long@@ ing from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to explore their feelings completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a staff of teleph@@ ony past@@ oral care , I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and sus@@ cep@@ tible to self @-@ murder has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness by talking openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friends is one of the shows that makes me sense when I try to offer long @-@ term operating mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of desp@@ air , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop of a completely new setting for the celebration of the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets , to help PSG , Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG @-@ player who brought the French master to the road , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before finally reaching their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ets@@ k also in Group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they not only asp@@ ire to qualifying for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to achieve in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two other goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , who was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw on the weekend in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was designated as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who beat the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and batt@@ led a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , there were some mis@@ carriage and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half alone , not less than five attempts , after Cav@@ ani had set it up after the rest@@ art .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a turning signal that was lo@@ wered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an outstanding intervention from Wil@@ and to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before sub@@ stitutes Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi assigned a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish le@@ ague , which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore colle@@ cts 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
in Switzerland , the Gl@@ enc@@ ore @-@ based mining giant , which is affected by single @-@ off@@ ending commodity prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday as part of its huge debt planning plan .
the Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , stated in a statement that it has sold new shares valued at approximately 1.6 billion £ in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , fights with falling commodity prices , since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn cr@@ ushes the demand and has a devast@@ ating effect on markets .
the issue of reference rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange when trading on early Wednesday morning .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as part of the broader plans to cut around a third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
the company sold the new Beteilig@@ ungen to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have decreased iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and replies to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yuan at a State D@@ iner once the two leaders have had bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis Visit will offer the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese collaboration in a series of global , regional and bilateral topics of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to approach areas of dis@@ agreements constructive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , initially announced in February , will likely meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi respond to a series of controversial questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South Chinese sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented Change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago in front of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , which at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion le@@ ague winner , twice world champion , twice European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he stood before the f@@ are@@ well in Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we have nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contrac@@ ted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , split the reds from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on performs variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the African American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives , in reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted , sho@@ cked , with s@@ worn un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments from the actor of The Mar@@ tian were strengthened .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers &apos; colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a gro@@ ove , beaten by her white emis@@ s@@ ary .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that her direc@@ ting &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni put his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO KNOW it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
women &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact r@@ acial representation in the media is at the foref@@ ront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter won nation@@ wide impact and urged legislat@@ ors and authorities to command discri@@ min@@ atory practices against color .
in February , the singer Prince played a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of entert@@ ainers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
professional sports clim@@ bers and control assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ eram@@ an Ge@@ off Br@@ itten , until the finale .
the climbing on a 75 foot rope climbing rope was one of the last tasks in 30 seconds .
Br@@ itten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked to E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock about winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had any more than 10.000 $ , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Br@@ itten , although he first completed the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
crowds of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had revers@@ ed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for a second season , the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak at Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ LI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
they used to be one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers are standing in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Twin@@ s wast@@ ed a chance to climb inside a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American le@@ ague wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon er@@ ased his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end strongly this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw any game in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and therefore I want to go into the game completely .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first runs since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the hammer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mit@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , saw clearly better off the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it into the game .
with three laps in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon made his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier on the Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran down the Wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who caught a Two @-@ Run at the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the conclusion @-@ run in the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
when Detroit added a Insurance run at the end of the ninth session , the Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed chess set S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from an un@@ event@@ ful Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es at the start of the game .
the tig@@ ers scored three rounds in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been cancelled prior to the game from the vulner@@ ability list , after he had been missing more than a month because of a back qui@@ ver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single at the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .

hundreds of refugees are to be killed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden communicated on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the capital of Hessen have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the last ten days alone , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , responsible for the initial tak@@ eover .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the f@@ are@@ well thought about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he disc@@ ar@@ ded the European states &quot; collective way@@ points . &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup had passed by a military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict glo@@ ws in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian female minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary , no one is sent back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has also sent no refugees to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria on the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee ship in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial consumption and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection are also committed to this .
but if you don &apos;t have a lead @-@ perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opinion has been dealt with in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , thousands of desperate refugees are stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
few hours later , the government in Budapest announced to tie the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ g@@ boat depar@@ tures from Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , e@@ ye@@ witnesses report@@ edly report thousands of migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the moon stag@@ ger easily around the ring plan@@ ed .
this de@@ af movement is only small , but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) of Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had discovered iron volcan@@ oes in 2006 at the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ mond , sp@@ itting the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terran@@ ean sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich lions the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of break @-@ break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ edit@@ ary loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the potential commitment of a non @-@ profit professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties presented a def@@ ensive man at first .

no dietary fruit - Man@@ gan@@ os contain a lot of sugar
man@@ go are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially sac@@ char@@ ose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. above all , they contain lots of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
they should not be too soft or too strong when buying .
the peel @-@ color alone does not indicate how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
you should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go gives also sav@@ ory dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf sal@@ ads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

on Wednesday and on the night of Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n blo@@ ws partly with storm @-@ strength through the cili@@ ary valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as met@@ e@@ o@@ news writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of a large deep @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west stream .
in the night on the mountain side of the Alps , the cave breaks through the valleys .
in the wake of the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning in the con@@ cili@@ ties with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the f@@ öh@@ n can advance to the adjacent centre and on the mountains even or@@ can arches of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my F@@ öh@@ n ensures summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , moisture starts to st@@ ow at the alpine slope .
here is a rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated in the south of the Alps , this after the last days large amounts of rain have fallen .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n gets out of the air , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind ch@@ ats up strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther court
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther site in Rome .
in the presence of city President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es could often only live in hiding their faith in the Pop@@ es of the Pop@@ es .
with the square I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the city as a comm@@ ent@@ able sin@@ ner @-@ be@@ ak at that time .
his negative impressions should be reinforced by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceu@@ ticals and Healthcare Hog@@ an Lov@@ ells
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorn is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated the Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 year old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the specific subjects , this can be quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years Ot@@ mar has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective artistic choice from the many subject areas of the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of All Books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cycles that focus on topics such as cru@@ ises , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood are created .
with this , he spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has separated himself on the basis of painting with the respective scrip@@ tures .
he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into today , into current contex@@ ts .
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible study by Martin Luther and a set of the artist who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately tri@@ ggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to re@@ vise this , in order to bring me back to my Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is that art becomes more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertising , and it is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displac@@ ed there .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; letting them look at themselves , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost held on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art has been : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not pay attention to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn approaching
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth ke@@ epers for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was already finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration ensured the destruction , especially among the inhabitants who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill seclu@@ ded , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval was received in October , the First Common Col@@ lec@@ tive Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further remembrance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga made a clear sign on the weekend .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehensi@@ bility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interesting for each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the crucial turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ensured that this program continued until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they are on the left jer@@ sey instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ en@@ logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ chef Rud@@ i V@@ öller , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy goes everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can help football clubs , no , we have to use our jet power , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hertha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the National Team of Women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championship of EM Quali@@ fication against Hungary on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensed clubs in their own locations had started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year , the association will present 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive board loses sight of accident in case of accident
the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a crash in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the accident on the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he had held in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , then drag@@ ged out on the road - that he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board Meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again when you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Cup against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach leaves open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its tri@@ bal position on the re@@ us position .
he thus announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief b@@ art@@ enders novel Bür@@ ki &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all European le@@ ague games in future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high probability , he will also ride the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ego@@ ing statement of fellow players Re@@ us , that the final proc@@ ession for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has to be the goal , keeps mid @-@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understand@@ able : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that makes Marco not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants pione@@ ering role for Germany
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the autom@@ aker I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 states , which come together with representatives of industry at the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ aper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are infl@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wishes to check the legal framework and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use internationally for example , that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is le@@ vi@@ ed from 10 to 130 mph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government also wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data within seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , co@@ er@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to around € 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Minister of Transport S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .

in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could also imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
almost every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at Table Tennis @-@ EM
according to the current status of the title , the Düsseldorf @-@ dorfer wants to only open up in sing@@ les on the 25th of September to 4 October .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Parliament Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sing@@ les @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also was missing and we became Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Council fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has drawn a heavy injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially neg@@ lec@@ ting attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been in Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just fine clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the present @-@ day work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having an education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total art work , for which a lot of effort was carried out : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged .
14 tons of material have r@@ ushed the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was another special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old ted@@ dy bears can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delic@@ ately fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents couldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught himself the disc@@ arding of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers who told Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , of course , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in a large quantity for customers , which , for example , processed for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en mo@@ wer@@ age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze mode , fashion played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewellery , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
generally , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who doesn &apos;t use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
we already have half of all orders .

our products hardly reach customers in this way .
the mass ware is now much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are we@@ aker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer explains from the nitrogen per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Out@@ enst@@ elle of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designer and the companies that have to think , above all , economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ bu@@ ked the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine sti@@ cked small ch@@ icks in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ ly Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a souven@@ ir .
thus I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ in &quot; movie
legends should not be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re@@ film , but a kind of continuation that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical ma@@ ids .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already certain : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wider towards the outside to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned to handle reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; said Xi .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , funding of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population mel@@ des@@ system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified which are not eligible for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it as@@ signs the market a major role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ of @-@ law business environment and designed the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transmitted to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card , &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as announced in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ ors and to for@@ bid the consumers a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ on tox@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization Food@@ Watch , which is a corresponding EU paper paper , critici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly stressed with mercury that , on the basis of the still existing limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ vo@@ cable .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to Food@@ Watch .
Food@@ Watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low @-@ charged that they already hold the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ del distr@@ action man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic for humans , which is heavily att@@ ested above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause especially un@@ born harm to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock , viol@@ ate more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European war@@ nings before mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
