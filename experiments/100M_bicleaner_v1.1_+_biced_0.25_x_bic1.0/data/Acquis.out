the community and states ensure that the protection of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used according to their laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same way as to the nationals of the states .
any claim that the community or a state against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or the state for damages - with the exception of any damage from a nuclear incident - which resulted from the implementation of the safegu@@ ards after the Convention , is governed in accordance with international law .
if the advice given to him by the General Director stipul@@ ates that the organization is not able to verify by examining that no core material that must be subject to the Convention , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear missi@@ le bodies , it can equi@@ p the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ ute and , if necessary , take the other measures provided there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account the degree of certainty achieved by applied security measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to provide the necessary security for the Council .
there are consultations on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention on the request of the organization , community or state .
the community and the states are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are examined by the Council .
the Council encourages the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes related to the conclusion of the Council in accordance with Article 19 or a procedure adopted by the Council , disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not agreed at the negotiating way or by another by the organization , the community and the states , shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states ap@@ point two refer@@ ees , the organization also ap@@ points two refer@@ ees , and the four called arbit@@ rators choose a fifth arbitr@@ ator .
if the community and the states or the organization have not been designated as arbit@@ rators within thirty days after the application for an arbit@@ ral tribunal , the community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point the arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure must be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This agreement shall apply to non @-@ core member states , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Association , in force , i ) when the relevant State of the Organization notes that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention and
II ) When the organization of the organization notes that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this agreement .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change in the Convention .
B ) All amendments require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all member states of the organization about any change in the Convention .
a ) This agreement enters into force on the day the organization of the community and states receives the written notification that their procedure for entry into force is completed .
B ) This agreement remains in force as long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of the Part I as necessary .
the aim of the safegu@@ ards laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the degradation of significant quantities of nuclear materials of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence by the risk of early detection .
for the enrich@@ ment of the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of examinations carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified Me@@ gen .
in carrying out their examinations , the organization makes full use of the security system of the community after article 3 full use .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material under this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their backup measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how it is determined more closely in the supplementary agreements and purpose @-@ serving :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of the material obtained , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the base material and the inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) determination , review and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) Proced@@ ure for valuation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system which points out the core material inventory and changes of the stock , including the input and output of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ent material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced specifically for non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the state material or other material produced at a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle in the states , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this convention .
a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community believes that the recovery of the core material , the securing measures under this agreement , is not possible or desirable , the organization and the community call each other about the application of suitable backup measures .
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are unanim@@ ously aware that this material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
upon request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures under this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material if it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
on the request of the Community , the organisation will liber@@ ate core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under the Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total amount of the core material released in the States is at no time more than
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold quad@@ rate of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of 10 metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material subject to the securing measures under this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ use of the backup measures on the material .
the Community meets with the organization of supplements which are necessary to determine the extent to which the organization &apos;s tasks are successful and effective in accordance with the Convention , in the individual determining how to apply the procedures established in the Con@@ ventions .
supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without alter@@ ing this agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the action between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report named in Article 62 , the organisation publishes a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material of this agreement in the states , irrespective of its origins , and carries on this inventory of invent@@ ories as a result of the following reports and the results of their follow @-@ up checks .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other .
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set up at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by common resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the goal of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound up within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special Trade F@@ unds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which the member states contribute to the F@@ TT ; this account is managed and used by the organization as ste@@ wards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , and is only used to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest recei@@ v@@ ables of the member state , which are to be paid on request in the currency of the state to order the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) Payment is made in two rates , namely the first amoun@@ ting to at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the ste@@ ward agreed time ;
II ) The second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may make payments before the dates mentioned above .
the administrator takes about proportion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the Notes in accordance with the usual procedure of the organisation , in order to cover the expenditure for the central bank loan and balance the transaction in an appropriate manner .
when granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional bor@@ rowing capacity to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be governed by contributions from other sources .
each loans loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly re@@ pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is considered , assessed , approved and managed according to the procedures and practices used for the development loans funded by the organization ( including the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ord@@ ental funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which has already been approved as part of a loan or loan for a program or project that has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force .
aside from Section 4 , the same pay@@ back conditions are subject to the same pay@@ back conditions that are generally valid for the development loan granted by the organization ; thus , in ten years of free years , they are re@@ pay@@ able in 50 years each .
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this watch must be paid directly to the organization that it retains .
each loans loan is to be issued by a separate lending agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is given in particular .
the income from each loans loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or rendered in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and who , on the basis of what the administrator has set at the time of the loan guarantee , may be a recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are carried out on the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in this way in the currency of a member state is to be rejected as soon as possible by the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC up to the complete awar@@ ding of all the standard loans to the E@@ EC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and by the directors .
during the period of payment of the central bank loan , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EW@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the central loan and the expenditure made for this .
the administrator tran@@ sm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account statement .
after full payment of the loans loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the E@@ EC conve@@ ys a detailed report about the projects and programs financed by the F@@ TT as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out of the account and the amounts paid to the account , and the payments made out of the account are visible to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issuing of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and about any other issues related to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date which the E@@ EC and the organisation possibly agree , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of all the loans taken by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement has been rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the Member States Govern@@ ments note the conclusion of the proceedings in question to the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat general direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications together with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .
this agreement will be effective and will enter into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wor@@ ding is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics

the agreement could be concluded by the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery fund of the member countries .
some conditions , however , are already mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be prepared .
for each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , without having exceeded a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for the extension of the extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit op@@ ener commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would occur in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would take account of the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applies at the time of transactions carried out under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market value .
however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary resources even on the market , the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum that corresponds to the corresponding margin increases .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks make an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would inform me of the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honour to inform you of the approval of the Council of the European Communities on the content of this letter .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . during these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled g@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tonnes , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the annual volume does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the surplus mentioned below , in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ ine@@ an approach to the community market is not affected by this agreement .
in case the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed amounts in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the imports from Argentina for the remainder of the year .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of the products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ stone rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
with the admission of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount determined by the Argent@@ ine@@ an trade in accordance with the size of the Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State .
import loads for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; here , the cancellation fee referred to under the number 5 will be taken into account .
the total volume mentioned under number 2 is set to 23 000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight by the Greek accession to the Community .
the community under@@ takes all to avoid market development that could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community has taken precau@@ tions so that the he@@ el of frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the conduct of the regulation par@@ agra@@ phs of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the goals and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as to slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms must be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by granting export lic@@ ences to the products listed under this agreement for the products listed under the number of 1 .
the Community , on its part , ple@@ dges to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issuing of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products originated in Argentina on the basis of an export license , which is issued by the authorities designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that a deposit may be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods in question .
in terms of implementing provisions , it is further specified that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the appropriate place of the Community informs the amounts for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; this information may , if necessary , be deci@@ ph@@ ered to destination country .
the Committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly reviews the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat market in both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions that are of importance for the goal known as 7 .
the Committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper use of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement of non @-@ named tari@@ ff numbers according to the Community .
the Committee discusses all the questions arising during the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stated at number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 .
the amount stated by the force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total annual rate and accounts for the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a term of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement are reviewed by both parties prior to 1 April 1984 , with regard to changes made comprehensible to them .
I would be grateful if you would share the agreement with your government .
I honour to confirm the entrance of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I respect the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . during these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows :

agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat
I encourage myself to take reference to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat .
recognizing the fact that the sheep farming and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb after the world market , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , it must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honour to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled g@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will ensure access to the market for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal sales of its H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat will not be affected by the application of the Regulation .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the amount of the annual volume does not exceed the set amount .
the previously set quantities are executed in conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the Community affir@@ ms that New Zealand cannot be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the market of the community .
should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the above mentioned provisions in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand that arise from this agreement .
in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the de@@ ple@@ tion to imports of products collected from this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ stone rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
when the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities fixed in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State .
import loads for these new Member States are set in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this respect , the clause 5 mentioned in clause 5 will be taken into account .
the total amount mentioned in clause 2 is set to 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight by the Greek accession to the Community .
the community under@@ takes all to avoid a market development that could affect the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community has taken precau@@ tions so that the he@@ el of intervention in frozen meat is not under@@ mined because of the implementation of the ordin@@ ance of this purpose .
in addition , both parties are undertaking everything in order to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ lei@@ sch in the Community without any danger to market stability .
taking into account the goals and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual use of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as to slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , only takes place at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the amounts mentioned in clause 2 in particular by granting no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities .
the Community is committed to making all necessary precau@@ tions so that issuing lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products originated in New Zealand on the basis of an export license issued by the government notified by the New Zealand government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that a deposit may be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods in question .
in terms of implementing provisions , it is further specified that the competent New Zealand authority in the appropriate place of the Community informs the relevant authorities at regular intervals , for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may , if necessary , be deci@@ ph@@ ered to destination country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement will be properly applied and smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee regularly reviews the tendency to the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including conditions that are of importance for the purpose specified in clause 7 .
the Committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper implementation of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement of non @-@ named tari@@ ff numbers according to the Community .
the Committee discusses all the questions arising during the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement are exemp@@ t from the rights and obligations of the parties in the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount of the amount stated by the entry into force this year to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual rate .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand on the one hand , as well as for the main area of New Zealand on the other hand .
this agreement enters into force on October 20 , 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a deadline of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement are verified by both parties before the 1st of April 1984 with regard to changes necessary for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor to propose if your government can agree to the standing that this letter and your reply will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ö@@ stlich der Uruguay on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . during these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled chicken , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff point 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common customs tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen chicken , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff point 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the common customs tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay , through appropriate procedures , obli@@ ges to ensure that the annual amount is not exceeding the agreed quantity and is executed according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the surplus mentioned below , in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community adop@@ ts the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the Uruguay imports for the remainder of the year .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the de@@ ple@@ tion to the imports of the products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ stone rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
when the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay will change the amount specified in accordance with the scope of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
import loads for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; here , the cancellation fee referred to under the number 5 will be taken into account .
the total amount stated under number 2 is set to 5 800 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight by the Greek accession to the Community .
the community under@@ takes all to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community has taken precau@@ tions so that the he@@ el of intervention in frozen meat is not under@@ mined because of the conduct of the regulation par@@ agra@@ phs by ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an Schaff@@ lei@@ sch .
taking into account the goals and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as to slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms must be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay , in particular , guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by granting out export lic@@ ences for the products listed under this agreement for the products listed under the number of 1 .
the Community , on its part , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issuing of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products , originating in Uruguay , is made dependent upon the submission of an export licence issued by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in terms of implementing provisions , it is further specified that the competent Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority in the appropriate place of the Community has regular intervals to share the quantities for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; this information may , if necessary , be deci@@ ph@@ ered to destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .

whereas the Member States , if necessary , support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in obtaining re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups , is highly desirable .
whereas this mutual support is only possible if the condition and use of these re@@ agents for the determination of the blood group jointly by the Member States are subject to the provisions set up by the Member States , and the necessary facilities and exceptions are granted for their import duties -
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this agreement , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group determination and to determine blood in@@ compati@@ bilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to the determination of blood group by signing this agreement , or by applying its rati@@ fication , approval or membership certificate , by an explanation directed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by a Noti@@ fication directed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the parties agree to leave re@@ agents for blood group determination against reimbur@@ sement of the costs of their extraction , preparation and carriage as well as , if necessary , the purchase price of other contracting parties , which they urgently need , provided they themselves possess sufficient supplies for their own need .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are provided to other contracting parties only under the condition that they are not associated with any profit , that they are only used for medical purposes and provided only to designated bodies by the governments involved .
each shipment of re@@ agents for the purpose of blood group identification is to add a certificate to the fact that they were manufactured according to the rules of the protocol .
the protocol and its system represent an administrative agreement that can be am@@ ended or am@@ ended by the governments of the Parties to this agreement .

the Parties shall submit a list of positions to each other about the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe , which are entitled to the issuing of the certificate provided in Article 4 .
these positions should be the same as possible with the places designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe to sign up ; they can become a contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or
this agreement enters into force a month after the day three members of the Council have signed or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it under Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval .
for each member , signed or rati@@ fied by the Convention , without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , it enters into force a month after its signature or the deposit of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate .
after entering into force , the Committee of the Council of Europe can invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notes the members of the Council and the accompanying member states a ) the timing of the entry into force of the Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
each contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe following a year &apos;s notice .
a re@@ agent for the determination of blood group must react with all tested blood samples containing an@@ tigen containing an@@ tigen containing the antibody or any other substance named on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated th@@ inning of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by volume of the blood cell in@@ sol@@ ation in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a property carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established international standards for anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B and Anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the purpose of blood group identification and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity .
according to the definition an international standard drug contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational agents , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te up@@ stream .
the title indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series in which a microsc@@ op@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination available for the International standard prepar@@ ates ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain 256 International units per ml according to definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative list of the standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; Anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory level of efficacy .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is appro@@ achable by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent government authorities can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for the determination of the blood group must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments , gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents needed for the international exchange should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally d@@ yed arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all levels of production and controls of the re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents have to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until a certain probability can be assumed that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used to determine the blood group can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective portion in three groups .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each box is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of liquid needed to re@@ plen@@ ish ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions provided by the container have the following details : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of liquid needed to re@@ plen@@ ish ,
