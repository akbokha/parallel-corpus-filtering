<seg id="645">A) In the implementation of safeguards after the Convention, the technological development is fully taken into account in the area of safeguards, and all efforts are made to ensure optimum cost effectiveness and the use of the principle of effective securing control of the flow of core material, which is subject to this Convention, through use of instruments and other technical processes at certain strategic points, as far as the current or future technology enables this.</seg>
<seg id="646">B) To ensure optimum cost effectiveness, for example, the following procedures are applied: I) spatial finger cutting as a means for determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes;</seg>
<seg id="647">III) Concentration of the review process on the phases of the fuel cycle, which could be produced for the production, processing, use and storage of nuclear materials, from which without further nuclear weapons and other nuclear missiles could be produced, and the greatest possible limitation of the verification procedure with other core material, provided that this does not hinder the implementation of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="648">A) To effectively implement the securing measures under this agreement, the Community of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention approves information on core material, which is subject to securing measures, and on the characteristics of the facilities which are necessary for the implementation of the safety measures concerning this material of Belang.</seg>
<seg id="649">B) The organization requires only the minimum of information and data compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="650">II) Information on facilities shall be limited to the minimum required for the use of safety measures concerning core material, which is subject to the securing measures under the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="651">C) On the request of the community, the organization is prepared to examine investment data, which the community considers to be particularly vulnerable, in the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="652">These data do not need to be materially transferred to the organization, provided that they remain inaccessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="653">A) i) The organization fetches the consent of the community and the states to the naming of inspectors for the states.</seg>
<seg id="654">II) Ensuring the community either against a proposed naming or at any time against a given naming, the organization of the community and the states proposes one or more alternative denominations.</seg>
<seg id="655">III) If due to the repeated refusal of the community to approve the appointment of inspectors of the organization that are handicapped because of this agreement, the Council will discuss the refusal by the Director General of the Organization - in the following as "the Director General" - in order to meet the goal of meeting appropriate measures.</seg>
<seg id="656">B) The Community and the States concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors of the organization can actually carry out the tasks assigned to them according to their convention.</seg>
<seg id="657">C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i) the possible harassment and disturbance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as small as possible;</seg>
<seg id="658">II) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information provided to the inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="659">Each State applies to the organization, including its assets, funds and assets, as well as to its inspectors and other officials to fulfill the provisions of the agreement on the privileges and liberations of the International Atomic Energy Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="660">The safeguards after this agreement are terminated with regard to nuclear materials when the community and the organization realize that the material has been used or diluted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity that is under the point of view of the security measures of Belang, or has practically not become recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="661">In accordance with this agreement, the Community notes the transfer of nuclear materials from the states subject to the safeguarding of the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="662">The safeguards after the Convention are terminated with regard to nuclear material as soon as the recipient state, as foreseen in the Convention, has taken responsibility for it.</seg>
<seg id="663">The organisation carries out documents from which any transfer and, if necessary, the re-application of the backup measures to the further core material.</seg>
<seg id="664">If core material, which is subject to the safeguarding of the Convention, shall be used in non-nuclear activities, such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics, the community shall agree to the organisation of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in relation to this material.</seg>
<seg id="665">II) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missiles during the period of non-use of the securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="666">B) The organisation and the community shall make a provision that the safeguards provided in this agreement shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity.</seg>
<seg id="667">As far as possible, the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these safeguards are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="668">In any case, the securing measures envisaged in this Convention will once again be applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity.</seg>
<seg id="669">The organization is kept out of the total quantity and composition of this material in the concerned state or the concerned States, and on any transmission of such material from this state or these states on the current state.</seg>
<seg id="670">This explains its agreement as swiftly as possible; it extends only on matters such as time and procedural rules and agreements for reporting, but does not include a approval or an under-secrecy knowledge of the military activity and does not apply to the success of the core material.</seg>
<seg id="671">The organization, the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations under the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="672">If the community, the states or persons, which are subject to their sovereignty, are subject to extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization, the organization will reimburse these costs, provided that it has been clarified beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="673">In any case, the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="674">The community and states ensure that the protection of liability for nuclear damage, including insurance or other financial security, can be used according to their laws and other regulations, to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same way as to the nationals of the states.</seg>
<seg id="675">Any claim that the community or a state against the organization or the organization vis-à-vis the community or the state for damages - with the exception of any damage from a nuclear incident - which resulted from the implementation of the safeguards after the Convention, is governed in accordance with international law.</seg>
<seg id="676">If the advice given to him by the General Director stipulates that the organization is not able to verify by examining that no core material that must be subject to the Convention, for nuclear weapons or other nuclear missile bodies, it can equip the reports provided in Article XII (C) of the Statute and, if necessary, take the other measures provided there.</seg>
<seg id="677">In such steps, the Council takes into account the degree of certainty achieved by applied security measures, and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to provide the necessary security for the Council.</seg>
<seg id="678">There are consultations on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention on the request of the organization, community or state.</seg>
<seg id="679">The community and the states are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are examined by the Council.</seg>
<seg id="680">The Council encourages the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council.</seg>

<seg id="695">The purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of the Part I as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="696">The aim of the safeguards laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the degradation of significant quantities of nuclear materials of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missiles for unknown purposes, as well as deterrence by the risk of early detection.</seg>
<seg id="697">For the enrichment of the target specified in Article 28, the material accounting is used as securing measure of fundamental importance, composite with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of examinations carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity, which is not proven for a certain period of time, is specified, indicating the accuracy limits for the specified Megen.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their examinations, the organization makes full use of the security system of the community after article 3 full use.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the community for core material under this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their backup measures, the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and, as far as necessary, foresee how it is determined more closely in the supplementary agreements and purpose-serving:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measuring system to determine the quantities of the material obtained, produced, lost, lost or otherwise removed from the base material and the inventory;</seg>

<seg id="708">H) Procedure to reimburse reports to the organization in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The securing measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) Uran - or thoriument material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, is introduced into the states, so the community of the organization divides the quantity and composition of the material, unless it is introduced specifically for non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) leaves the core material, which is suitable for fuel production or isotope enrichment, the plant or the process phase in which it is produced, or is introduced into the state material or other material produced at a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle in the states, so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The securing measures envisaged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11. if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled, the Community believes that the recovery of the core material, the securing measures under this agreement, is not possible or desirable, the organization and the community call each other about the application of suitable backup measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The securing measures envisaged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community are unanimously aware that this material is practically non-refundable.</seg>
<seg id="714">Upon request of the Community, the organisation frees the following core material from the securing measures under this agreement:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material if it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) Nuclear material if it is used in non-nuclear activities according to Article 13 if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of plutonium-238, which is above 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">On the request of the Community, the organisation will liberate core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under the Convention, from these safeguards, provided that the total amount of the core material released in the States is at no time more than</seg>

<seg id="723">C) twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">If the core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material subject to the securing measures under this agreement, precautions are made for the re-use of the backup measures on the material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community meets with the organization of supplements which are necessary to determine the extent to which the organization's tasks are successful and effective in accordance with the Convention, in the individual determining how to apply the procedures established in the Conventions.</seg>
<seg id="726">Supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without altering this agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention. the organization, the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements come into force within ninety days after the entry into force of the Convention; an extension of this period requires the action between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report named in Article 62, the organisation publishes a summarized inventory of the entire core material of this agreement in the states, irrespective of its origins, and carries on this inventory of inventories as a result of the following reports and the results of their follow-up checks.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other.</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set up at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by common resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the goal of the EEC and the Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound up within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organization have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization arranges a special account under the name "" "" "" "" Special Trade Funds "" "" which the member states contribute to the FTT; this account is managed and used by the organization as stewards "" "" (in this property the organization is referred to as "" "" caretaker "" ""), and is only used to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. "" "</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest receivables of the member state, which are to be paid on request in the currency of the state to order the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment is made in two rates, namely the first amounting to at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the steward agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) The second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the EEC and the administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may make payments before the dates mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="740">The administrator takes about proportionate drawing on the cash or the Notes in accordance with the usual procedure of the organisation, in order to cover the expenditure for the central bank loan and balance the transaction in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its additional borrowing capacity to loan terms without disagreement; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be governed by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each loans loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly repayable development program or project (including a sectoral project), which is considered, assessed, approved and managed according to the procedures and practices used for the development loans funded by the organization (including the letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordental funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization which has already been approved as part of a loan or loan for a program or project that has already been approved by the Bank's directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Aside from Section 4, the same payback conditions are subject to the same payback conditions that are generally valid for the development loan granted by the organization; thus, in ten years of free years, they are repayable in 50 years each.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for the payment of this watch must be paid directly to the organization that it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each loans loan is to be issued by a separate lending agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is given in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The income from each loans loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or rendered in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, which are members of the organization and who, on the basis of what the administrator has set at the time of the loan guarantee, may be a recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are carried out on the special transaction account, and the amount refunded in this way in the currency of a member state is to be rejected as soon as possible by the caretaker to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches the EEC up to the complete awarding of all the standard loans to the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the central bank loan, the caretaker teaches the EWG quarterly on the development of the central loan and the expenditure made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the expiration of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external auditor of the organization to this account statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the loans loan, the caretaker of the EEC conveys a detailed report about the projects and programs financed by the FTT as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid out of the account and the amounts paid to the account, and the payments made out of the account are visible to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the full issuing of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and about any other issues related to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date which the EEC and the organisation possibly agree, the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of all the loans taken by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement has been repaid and transferred to the Member States, this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval by the Member States and the EEC according to the procedural rules of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The Member States Governments note the conclusion of the proceedings in question to the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities.</seg>
<seg id="764">The Secretariat general directs these notifications together with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="765">This agreement will be effective and will enter into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the aforementioned notifications in the organization.</seg>
