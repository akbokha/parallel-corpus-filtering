this document is a summary of the European Public Auth@@ orities Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the drug application .
if you need further information about your illness or its treatment , please read the package insert ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inhal@@ ing ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ l thought and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental illness in which patients alternate man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elation ) with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have used the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulties swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , as well as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells through neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters , i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells among each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be the &quot; partial agit@@ ator &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters , works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over to a year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , involving 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to take @-@ up .
in the two trials with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving a placebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented more effective recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients as placebo for up to 74 weeks and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
am@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo , the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances , tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , headache , bl@@ urred vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( di@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mostly had man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes continued to out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the board came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing authorisation of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased dose of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder did not have an increased risk of suicide in comparison with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in patients with bi@@ polar disorder .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiac diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , ab@@ ly@@ sis ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ous and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with am@@ bili@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should regularly be monitored with regard to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination abilities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , respectively an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ zers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metaboli@@ tes .
considering the joint gift of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered jointly with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ ate concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the lack of data on humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies , unless the potential use justi@@ fies the potential risk for fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against operating dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole does not have any negative influence on it .
the following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total decreased incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients taking O@@ lan@@ cers therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder : in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients with placebo @-@ treated patients was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of the patients treated with placebo .
among the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since launch un@@ intentionally or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is of benefit in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma rate retention .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine recept@@ ors .
in the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in dos@@ ages from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C ra@@ cl@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the cau@@ dat@@ us nucle@@ us and on the put@@ stream .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents who contributed to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions@@ rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ cer controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for over 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus placebo showed no superior efficacy .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
furthermore , in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ling of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean exclusion period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in extensive metaboli@@ tes about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ tes over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ based effects .
a link @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ ni@@ city affili@@ ation or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) did not show any significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre @-@ clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ mentation @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ u@@ bility .
rab@@ bits were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ cer controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for over 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus placebo showed no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets reached 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) .
rab@@ bits were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically installed , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and commen@@ ce with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the resor@@ ption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended while b@@ yp@@ assing obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine used for conservation or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiac diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , ab@@ ly@@ sis ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ous and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should regularly be monitored with regard to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination abilities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after al@@ loc@@ ating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were used as one @-@ off intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and who received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ tes , in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ tes , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after al@@ loc@@ ating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with placebo and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of the patients treated with placebo .
among the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant higher improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents who contributed to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ rates range , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ e- ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ cer controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms which were partially not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C was 90 % greater than the AU@@ C after the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application no safety @-@ related concerns arose after mat@@ ernal exposure that was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre @-@ clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have been observed only in doses or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
also , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
considering only those who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in regard to efficacy indicators such as time until disease worsen@@ ing and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
it must also not be used in patients who have low blood rates in the blood before the treatment begins .
the CH@@ MP Committee established that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel in order to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ es &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
at sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached at Grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there have been no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ article formulation from Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which could have substantially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel again .
in patients , no new abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ es rose to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if patients with nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in patients with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , unless the mother &apos;s treatment with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to have no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm con@@ formation before treatment , as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the transport ability and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects performed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III clinical trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was rapidly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 contains the side effects performed in conjunction with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , f@@ lange pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very often :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive account in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estim@@ ations of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an an@@ timi@@ c@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active substance that promotes the accumulation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhi@@ bition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components is medi@@ ated into endotheli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel through the endotheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ant protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ obstruc@@ ted studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given intraven@@ ously over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 m@@ g. / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer for over 30 minutes .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel every 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 m@@ g. / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 2@@ 29 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ cation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 meg@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy first , 27 % had only an adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ az@@ ation and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 Results of the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for bas@@ eline decay due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions by Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane on patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high volume of distribution points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 of solvent containing Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose associated with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which points to a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was verified at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light over 8 hours .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic agent , and as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be avoided when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

member states must ensure that the owner of the marketing authorization for the market introduction will provide medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . • With clear visual representation of the correct use of the product , cooling boxes for transport are provided by the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ blood values , in which complications could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion in case a blood donation is not possible before the intervention and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed needs to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored prior to the treatment to ensure that iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or because the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
when administered as an injection in a vein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein for at least eight weeks before receiving either el@@ amed or still receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period during the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of cut@@ ted Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug .
August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce medicinal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma , which includes chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger surgical interventions that require large blood volume compensation ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of third @-@ party blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and results may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease ; therefore , the doctor requires the assessment of the individual clinical condition and condition of the disease .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed over or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in inst@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest legal dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia which is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia which is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times per week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical condition and condition of disease is required by the physician .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in inst@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest legal dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of treatment of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ticul@@ u@@ loid count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained once a week , 150 I.@@ E. / kg once a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ ticul@@ u@@ loid numbers &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l are increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ idal number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ticul@@ u@@ loid number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an indication of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , where the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed received a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program started , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively charged 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation .
patients who suffer from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any stre@@ amed or any other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ embo@@ lis@@ m ) .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or underlying disease : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of the carcin@@ oid or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effects , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ tic value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ umin@@ ous intoxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the label is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cytes numbers are normal , and if no other reason for a loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibody should be determined and an examination of the bone marks for diagnos@@ ing a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the application of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for the control of the an@@ a@@ emia @-@ symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should amount to 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients with chemotherapy a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered for the evaluation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is exceeded , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the participation of each patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial out@@ patient value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was sought
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidney were reported in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common adverse effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the ery@@ thropo@@ genic treatment .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can occur after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sides with respect to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ ec@@ al patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thropo@@ genesis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression in tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to the controls in the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ embo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions following repeated intraven@@ ous application showed half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life time of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row Fi@@ bro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row contrac@@ ture was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 . in animal @-@ experimental studies with approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased hyper@@ b@@ ital body weight , to a delay in the oscill@@ ation and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports support in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the relevant authorities of the member states , the owner of the marketing authorization has to provide the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , label and packaging allowance . • With clear visual representation of the correct use of the product , cooling boxes for transport are provided by the patient .
the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmaceutical co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , is set up and functional before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is used in the traffic .
the owner of the marketing authorisation for the placing on the market is obliged to implement the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , as outlined in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • receiving new information that might have an impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the measures to minim@@ ise risk • within 60 days after reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mile@@ stones • following the call by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first @-@ occurring or reinforced breast pain ) , the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis in veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) exists - for example , if such a blood gra@@ ft has occurred in the past .
you suffer from severe circulation disturbances of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the blood plat@@ el@@ et number , which is reg@@ ressed during further treatment .
your doctor may carry out regular blood tests if necessary to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
iron deficiency , red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be taken into account and treated with se@@ amed before beginning treatment .
ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported to be very rare after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in case you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , he will termin@@ ate your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled .
this is why Ab@@ se@@ amed needs to be given by inj@@ ecting into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk for problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
if you raise or increase the levels of potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with se@@ amed until the potassium values lie back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs with inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia associated with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your red blood pigment levels ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event as low as possible .
this risk should be taken very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past , thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary embo@@ lis@@ m ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and , under certain circumstances , can have a negative effect on the tumor .
if you are facing a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , before the treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood pigment ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines / apply it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may order certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are the means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you &apos;re well set , you get regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like falling down ; • Disease Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( agent against inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ ella may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was studied over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spine frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most Ac@@ la@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ ella may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information on how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tract contra@@ indication in pregnancy and nursing women • Re@@ quired a proper intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When on medical or nursing aid is available
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently lit@@ te low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after the treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ ella is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with a sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , which occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , can develop because of the fast implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , oral hygiene should be performed prior to treatment of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
for patients who need dental intervention , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious side effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which were associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred , at 2.3 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the patients with Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently frac@@ tured hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ och@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was observed , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ onic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients was diagnosed with oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the field of an ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric level frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly lowered over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients of 75 years and over had a 60 % reduction in the risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta had an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the basin comb .
in comparison with placebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the overall survival was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , in comparison to placebo treatment , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D on the total and th@@ igh@@ s at all times .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.@@ 3 % at the enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to the weekly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , above all mild to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase correspon@@ d@@ ingly to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when taken into the study ) .
11 Eff@@ ectiv@@ eness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients receiving ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained in the mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
five and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma levels quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value of 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life cycles of ½ a 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early phases of distribution ( α and β , with the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zinc acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
a reduced clearing of metaboli@@ zed cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
because for severe ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restric@@ tive data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ l@@ al @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was administered in rats by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure relative to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure showed toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common findings in repeated use studies was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats followed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

Ris@@ ko Management Plan The owner of the authorization for placing on the market obli@@ ges the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application and all the following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP guidelines for risk management systems for medical medic@@ aments , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is known that could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ onic acid is a compound class agent called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass which is observed in men .
in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure becomes too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ ella works by reg@@ ain@@ ing the bone structure again , ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forcing the bones .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines / apply it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta , together with foods and drinks , you are concerned that you can take sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta appears for a long time , you may need a further dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you when you need a renewed treatment .
when the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before you finish the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , if you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are frequent ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache appear within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms as you get Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical symptoms due to too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or deaf feel , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were reported in particular in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture it is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ ella two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the fast implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

in addition , there were four studies involving over 7@@ ,000 patients , in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent to set up smoking in comparison to a placebo .
the studies on the setting of the smoking did not show any consistent results , so that the effect of compli@@ a on this field of application was difficult to assess .
the most common A@@ compli@@ a side effects observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .

in the case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it is also possible for patients who - besides obesity - do not have any recognis@@ able risks , can cause depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other nearby persons ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek emergency medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

in some cases , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with the animals .
the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery of the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle disorders .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development an exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Auth@@ orities Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the study evaluated how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the drug application .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be adequately adjusted in the highest acceptable dose with met@@ form@@ in alone .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ x resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the acet@@ ate treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utili@@ sed and the blood sugar level decreases , which means that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ in was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ x resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced by doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the trial , the effect of an additional donation from Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ x resin in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who additionally took account of insulin had lowered the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain , and hypo@@ thes@@ isation ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos must neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos ought to be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under the age of 18 no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) are at risk of developing a de@@ compensated heart failure , the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing pharmac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in the reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone may not be used in patients with increased output h@@ ep@@ atic cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit ) or with other signs of liver disease .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be controlled as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ growth problems , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on should be conducted prior to the examination of the laboratory parameters by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) was a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ op@@ r@@ its by 3.1 % and 1 @-@ 2 % relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who have pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ x resin or dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch it was reported in the treatment of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ te indi@@ ces , including pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , an incidence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and the incidence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report disturbances of visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occ@@ ured at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if one patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel block@@ ers and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on around 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in- and elevated insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated from present data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , AL@@ T ad@@ pins over three times the upper limit of the standard range were similar to placebo but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ x resin .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , but more frequently when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative medications .
in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occ@@ ured at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone seems to be an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it has been shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to study the time until the end of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or placebo .
in patients with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was observed .
clinical trials over a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week investigation of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d reduced total plas@@ mat@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was found under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , while impaired values were observed in Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level but also improved the post @-@ fla@@ x increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both via an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized , who received either Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is quickly resor@@ bed , with the top concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in plasma normally achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the efficacy of about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on does not have any relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in humans , the marker was found mainly in the f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination lifetime of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans , and the total active metaboli@@ tes are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral safety in the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies included mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in- and elevated insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occ@@ ured at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease compared to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level but also improved the post @-@ fla@@ x increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both via an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which showed a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medications , an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women was shown .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was diagnosed with 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane caused a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level that indicated that blood sugar levels were similarly lowered as with a different human insulin .
acet@@ ab@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the full list of the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes in relation to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a quick initi@@ ale effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , insulin type ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to acet@@ ab@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a transition from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
before traveling , which go through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account potential interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for any other medication they have taken .
4 . both hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with transi@@ ent or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sion@@ ally - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort , which are ter@@ med as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 . however , an intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar can be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Gel@@ eg - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection point a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur if it was missed to change the en@@ grav@@ ings within the injection area .
during insulin therapy local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection point ) .
diseases of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sion@@ ally - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions Symp@@ toms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ otic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / unconscious .
however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an un@@ read help person or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total working time is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the division is active .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
it is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ p@@ ated according to the instructions for use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a transition from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
the doctor must therefore take into account potential interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for any other medication they have taken .

13 . however , an intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar can be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
the termin@@ ale half @-@ life time ( t ½ ) is therefore rather a measure of resor@@ ption than a measure of elimination by se of insulin from the plasma ( insulin has a t ½ of only a few minutes ) .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystal de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ ills ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger gran@@ ular deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still over 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg per day .
during the first months of treatment , arthritis cases still occur , so it is recommended that patients take further medicines for prevention of rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / d@@ l. during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once daily , had a urine acid level in the blood from below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular , in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering urine acid levels in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ an@@ ium deposits ( including one from the case history known or current pla@@ iting no@@ des and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) .
if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restrictions , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t receivers , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ essing medication , acute arthritis can occur during the treatment process because of the reduction of serum h@@ edge acid levels , ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment ( Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
disorders of the liver during Phase 3 clinical trials were observed with slight symptoms of liver function values in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment and , depending on the clinical findings and a liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ ein was not carried out interactions with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhi@@ bition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine level ( a inhi@@ bition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous offering of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient applied at the same time .
in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x showed a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an@@ ta@@ zi@@ d@@ um containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de inhi@@ bit the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but does not cause significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not leave side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal @-@ experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not ad@@ ver@@ sely affect their performance .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients with the last three month @-@ monthly serum levels of &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum @-@ incre@@ mental value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering serum levels of &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 times a day ; 10 patients with serum in@@ trin@@ sic values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 times daily .

with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations of ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT ) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction in serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of arthritis cases , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against g@@ out in the months ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need any treatment against g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of patients having a complete disappearance of the g@@ utter no@@ des up to the month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ I@@ U / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) by F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma retention of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ changeable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine there were about 45 % of the dose in the stool as un@@ changeable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) .

these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were approximately 4.1 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was accompanied by a decrease in breeding performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet containing a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which is to take place at the earliest thirty minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after 15 weeks of treatment , patients with low vitamin D levels were lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( indi@@ ges@@ tion ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , vom@@ iting ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic tum@@ ors .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied .
it must not be applied in case of diseases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or dissolve the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract apart from P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should alert attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be noted that symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn can stop the medicine and seek medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue to take on symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while there was no increased risk in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cers , including some severe and with complications , were rare ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regi@@ men predominantly contain intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available to indicate whether bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ atal treatment is reduced in patients who need a lower surgical procedure and reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised to take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the designated day of the week .
other diseases that affect the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or nursing women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients , but also for oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , intake of serum cal@@ ci@@ ums rose to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at following an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ tured Inter@@ ven@@ tional Study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the medium @-@ sized asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering from one or more spine frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the incidence of at least one new spine frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption Be@@ et@@ ted to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased by about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis stages , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats yiel@@ ded that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but is then rapidly re@@ distributed to the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted into the urine .
elimination After the intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate approximately 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
after IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing were not 200 ml / min .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted at rats using the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not thought that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by means of these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion The average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine was 2,4 % in urine after 48 hours , 4.@@ 9 % in the f@@ ences after 4 days .
characteristics in patients &quot; prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is ex@@ cre@@ ted rapidly over the urine .
although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly higher level of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

adv@@ ant is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , compared to the application of adv@@ ant with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after one year ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter follow @-@ up studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t have been carried out and examined how adv@@ ant is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , headaches , nausea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of the blood ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious if others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ phs , since the Adv@@ ant@@ f dosage or the dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ arded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atin capsules , printed in red ink on the bright yellow cap@@ s@@ ular top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ s@@ ular bottom with &quot; A@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or super@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; ren@@ dition of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood level measurements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; )
following the change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tables should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after adjustment .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tables are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ ant@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night @-@ ran@@ splan@@ tation period .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clearing substance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ant@@ f dose scheme can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not oral in the first postoperative period , the intraven@@ ous tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus therapy ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate can be initiated to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose @-@ adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change after the transplan@@ t is stabili@@ sed during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation .
dose recommendation - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f must be changed from twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ f , so this conversion has to be done at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t following a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ ant once a day , the treatment must begin with the recommended oral dose recommended in the kidney and liver transplan@@ t for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
in adult patients , which are converted to adv@@ an@@ agra@@ phs , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ enti@@ a in lung , pancre@@ atic and col@@ on graf@@ ted patients , patient Pro@@ gra@@ f was administered in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ral @-@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose @-@ adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine @-@ index and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case using whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ c controls .
it is recommended frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tables during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled following conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ant , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or concur@@ rent use of substances which could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
the indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the seb@@ um of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and gar@@ nish - and transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus differences or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; ren@@ dition of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the close control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have been shown to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ ant@@ f .
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , no clinical data are available for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ ant@@ f .
due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , taking herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be avoided , or other herbal remedies during a treatment with adv@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels under such circumstances may be subject to considerable fluctuations .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f there was an anterior or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ant@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor .
if patients take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ arded , lac@@ tose are contained , particular caution is given in patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was done with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the inhi@@ bition of gastro@@ intestinal transit .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al ex@@ positions , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( particularly in terms of its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs cannot be determined precisely because of the primary disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects following their frequency are listed in decreasing order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are often increased suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of B@@ Cs @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ ant .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors combined with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus therapy .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ u@@ bility and the high bond to ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ te protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell interior .
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis over a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival after one year was 8@@ 0,@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans occurred in 2@@ 1,7 % compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly higher ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
a multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation based on a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently reached for the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplantation in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cereb@@ ral transplan@@ ts ) under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus which lead to tal@@ low doses between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplan@@ t ir@@ radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sour@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly takes place via the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f for stable patients treated with Pro@@ gra@@ f ( once daily ) in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose .
it is recommended frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tables during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have been shown to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ ant@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2,@@ 6 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ ant@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ ant@@ f was compared with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibody production , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients .

in total , 34 patients of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in were converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus while only 6 Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients needed another therapy ( Bech@@ stein et al . , Transplan@@ tation 2004 ; 77 : 12@@ 21 ) .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application is based on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced using a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to form the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years of age , the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new anti@@ sep@@ tics with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the launch of Adv@@ ate in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the danger for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , a reasonable determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma gas is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities is not reached or if the bleeding with a proper dose is not controlled , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ory values it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the speed of passage should be directed after finding the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) pro ml plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 positioning days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors were observed .
because of the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the AD@@ R@@ s used in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who had a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the total of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirrors in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected .
previously untreated patients in a current clinical trial consisted of 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that showed an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reports over hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the factor VI@@ II activated acts as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of factor X activated by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of Factor VI@@ II @-@ Ac@@ tivity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over trial with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients right or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

non @-@ clinical data , based on trials on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , acute , repeated and local toxic@@ ity and gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , show no specific risk for humans .
each pack consists of a pier@@ cing bottle with powder , a water bottle with 5 ml sol@@ vents ( both glass type I with chlor@@ ob@@ ut@@ yl rubber stop@@ pers ) and a re@@ constitution unit ( BA@@ X@@ J@@ EC@@ T II ) .
when the product is still stored in the refrigerator , remove both tap bottles with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E powder and solvent from the refrigerator and warm up at room temperature ( between 15 and 25 ° C ) .
a significant increase in pulse frequency can usually be reduced immediately by slow or temporary break of the injection ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .

based on the data available since the first approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited distributed the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the advent of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
it is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene present in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer appeared in the area of the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in inj@@ ections in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Tum@@ ors benefit patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company did not have sufficient evidence that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal had consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passionate @-@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nose path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reli@@ eved on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients recorded their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received a@@ emia reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received lost medication alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for treating allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in patients suffering from con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without biting , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under the age of 12 .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms cease .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within the 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ gest@@ osis which can be performed per@@ tin@@ ally or nas@@ ally as swa@@ b of Rhin@@ o ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data did not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of a@@ Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data did not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that the treatment must be stopped when a hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( like headache or strengthening the headache ) .
caution is advised when treating the following patient groups : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder neck and bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is present at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of des@@ cal@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo , regardless of whether or not alcohol was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n enzyme has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not block C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vi@@ vo , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not reveal any increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , it should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to impair@@ ment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible abdominal operations .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness , increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , transp@@ ir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - dil@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhi@@ bition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ ins on endotheli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no longer showed any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective anxiety or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s took part , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by means of the total duration for the symptoms ( except nose mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ cal@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city belonging to patient groups .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered .
after the per@@ tin@@ ent application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze for healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test persons were badly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was equivalent to exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with deser@@ tification does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination did not possess any greater toxic@@ ity than its single components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , the pharmaceutical co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

tell your doctor if you have the following symptoms or diseases when using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • Blood blood pressure • heart ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache , or strengthening of existing headaches .
when taking Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine .
air@@ ti@@ ghtness and the use of machines If the recommended dosage is applied , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or decreases the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in good time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleeping disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .
pal@@ pit@@ ations or cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , increased physical activity , redness , heat waves , confusion , bl@@ urred vision , dry eyes , nas@@ al bleeding , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , stomach upset , nausea , nausea , ch@@ ills , reduction of the sense of smell , abnormal liver strains , anxiety , anxiety and irrit@@ ability .
after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes were reported very rarely .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ases , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pains , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of hepatitis and cases of conspic@@ uous liver impair@@ ments were also very rare reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a for inhal@@ ation ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for accepting .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml of sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by investigating the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , difficulty of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptoms ( the number of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline in symptoms was followed after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical trials on the effectiveness of the use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should take place according to the previous disease process and may be termin@@ ated after the termination of the symptoms and resum@@ ed during their recur@@ rence .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in clinical trials with chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to light that can lead to impair@@ ment of transportation or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials of different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in those treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported in placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 was the most common adverse event of headaches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study in which up to 45 mg of des@@ cal@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ phase clinical dose ) were administered .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhi@@ bition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin on Endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses given in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was reported .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ time of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no longer showed any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective anxiety or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown in the total quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , despite the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similarly refrac@@ tive and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
since the history of hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that in addition to the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also possible to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in the rate of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of the placebo @-@ treated patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient @-@ demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of deser@@ tification was achieved in 4 % of the patients .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data exists which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n metaboli@@ se and experience higher levels of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ I@@ som@@ nia in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not reinforced while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ cal@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti @-@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ cal@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ cal@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was reported .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ time of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restric@@ tive phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation on children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are restricted .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ X about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .

immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melt tablets in children under 6 years of age has not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ chlor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile determined in adult patients .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ I@@ som@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported in placebo were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
an additional study showed no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ cal@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was determined .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as shown in the total quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decrease effectively the exer@@ ted strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the influ@@ enza of avi@@ an H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread by humans to humans because people have not yet built up immunity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies quickly in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as alien ) is cleaned up , puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in participating in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for use , but this cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
gener@@ al@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is calculated according to the body weight .
when taking in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , it reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , may delay damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
aging was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the medicine used with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults , earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ generic ase was less effective than ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study with adults that had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine used with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r extracts the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger deteri@@ oration of the viral load after four weeks as in patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just like aging , and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take aging are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of aging in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors out@@ weigh the risks of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years .
generic ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of aging in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; generic ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of gas in the European Union .
aging is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , am@@ ul@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be administered together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is reduced by 14 % less than by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 . if A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
aging is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of ag@@ glomer@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
it may not be given at the same time using medicines which have low therapeutic wid@@ ths and may also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ generic ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal disease progression .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant medical information about this medicine .
patients with pre@@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin depends on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , concur@@ rent administration with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( controlled by the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
in patients who take these drugs at the same time , am@@ it@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ i@@ tism , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the as@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
gener@@ al@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the incidence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many of the patients had other illnesses related to their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude must not be given at the same time using medicines which have low therapeutic wid@@ ths and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines , whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in attempting to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were frequently observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels are and , if possible , to check the viral load and dep@@ ose the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ ly fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r have been used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % humili@@ ates if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of ag@@ res@@ sis in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is not carried out , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ on component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the in@@ takes of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and ag@@ glomer@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in the case of E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ a@@ virus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with azi@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ O ) once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if applied together with aging , may lead to interactions .
the patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with aging .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as gener@@ al@@ ase since it can result in resor@@ ption dysfunction .
simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enz@@ ym@@ atic duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
concur@@ rent intake with ag@@ glomer@@ ase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ b@@ ance and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the fluor@@ os@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous application of aging with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metaboli@@ zation is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , marked increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time as ap@@ hor@@ ase .
as plasma level increases in these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased concur@@ r@@ ently with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , al@@ ase may not be used together with or@@ ally recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while applying par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicates a possible rise in mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma levels by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ i@@ tism , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation of how to adjust the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is simultaneously administered with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with concur@@ rent offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with aging , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not fores@@ eeable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended concur@@ r@@ ently with a gener@@ al@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the possible benefits to the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
in the lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to mother &apos;s milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the pick@@ up in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of aging was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the aging treatment were mild until moder@@ ately pronounced , occurred early and rarely led to treatment ab@@ rup@@ tions .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking as@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) assessed by investig@@ ators as related to study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ etal adi@@ pose tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so @-@ cervical fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated subjects treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( breast@@ feeding ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , patients with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or lean nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occ@@ ured during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received a@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very common .
in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed at signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral gene and ga@@ g pol@@ arity revers@@ al stages with the result of an un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro v. HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M at ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhi@@ bition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ pat@@ tern@@ ed treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children , in which vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 4@@ 2@@ A / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed more than 96 weeks in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ical evaluation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic evaluation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these genetic patterns with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain degree of cross resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Resist@@ enz@@ aids , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , din@@ ing@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , equ@@ in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) seem to cause .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early failure of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can ad@@ ver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of aging in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the PRO@@ 300@@ 17 study , a random@@ ized open study , in which patients treated with PI ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nuclear therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of time @-@ adjusted average change from bas@@ eline ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ inferior threshold of 0.4 to 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , doses of 15 mg / kg were taken three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with aging .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell counts of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake imp@@ acted the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given at the same time using as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio @-@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore , the ag@@ glomer@@ ase solution and ag@@ glomer@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al function on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schem@@ as lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ ons comparable to those achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without concur@@ rent schedul@@ ing of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were observed in doses that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and In @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations involving human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
to date , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during administration or after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at 4 days age showed a high mortality in both the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rabbit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 . if A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( controlled by the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
generic ase should be set to a duration of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose may be 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the fluor@@ os@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with concur@@ rent offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with aging , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous application of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or less .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the pick@@ up in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of aging was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed at signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro v. HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , treatment optimisation in the treatment of PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given at the same time using as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al function on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be negli@@ gible .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were observed in doses that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cel@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .

toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at 4 days age showed a high mortality in both the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ ating the metabolism path@@ ways are not fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . ) are not fully mature .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for taking into account is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ oo@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into account was neither proven with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is reduced by 14 % less than by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution for taking the capsules ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for the A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , an application of an A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reactions as a result of high pro@@ p ly@@ sis , A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent administration may lead to a competitive inhi@@ bition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( controlled by the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
gener@@ al@@ ase should be removed for a long time if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
concur@@ rent intake with ag@@ glomer@@ ase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and result in associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ b@@ ance and pri@@ ap@@ ism associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s oral administration is expected to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , the potential risk for the intake should not be used during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to mother &apos;s milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the pick@@ up in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of the 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of aging was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking as@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ pat@@ tern@@ ed treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
early failure of a failing 60 treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which can ad@@ ver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immort@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large c@@ ousin volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In the case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is performed five times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin so that it stays on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo were performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials involving 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . in the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the placebo @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % to 18 % in the placebo arm treated with Al@@ dar@@ a .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ( AK@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults when the size or number of les@@ ions limit efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream should continue until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions were healed completely , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pron@@ u@@ cle@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ k@@ ture .
when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous applic@@ ators for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal area there are no clinical experiences so far .
limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ine reductions in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group in relation to the removal of the enti@@ cing war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data on long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs . therefore , the use of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical trial point out that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip area .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the lower arms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions are frequent , but these reactions normally decrease over the course of therapy in intensity or go back after setting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions to the patient cause severe discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be used with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
there are no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were obtained , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects include complaints at the location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III are shown below .
the most common adverse event , perhaps , or perhaps associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , were in these studies a response to the location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
according to the protocol , this placebo @-@ controlled trial evaluated clinical signs that in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream frequently went to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ment / sk@@ aters ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , assessment of the clinical signs indicated that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe snor@@ ing and sti@@ cking ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of the ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was found with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental one @-@ time oral absorption of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headaches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment is significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
at 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine the patients were completely cured ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super @-@ artificial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in one or two weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acts within a related 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , pa@@ edi@@ atric patients usually do not follow the approved indications , ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages that were studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of the serum in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were reported in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated apparent half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2@@ hrs half @-@ life time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the absorption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin in patients aged 6 to 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super @-@ functional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month trial for der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat rates , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg are significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months for der@@ mal application resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in der@@ mal administration of three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application point .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low system absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low as a result of systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the non @-@ active cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
at the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal sized liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion location .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed each year , possibly updating this summary .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms concerning the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or h@@ ep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect associated with in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion session ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , virtually all patients may form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with care when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer interval , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously advised due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity .
60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with medication ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or Anti@@ py@@ escu ) to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen must be considered .
in@@ fusion can be re @-@ recorded with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and length@@ ening in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table below : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in previous history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory condition and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug interactions with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with the predomin@@ ance of severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients underwent a ser@@ o@@ conversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a severe disease in patients aged under 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until a premature exp@@ ir@@ ation from the study ) , there were no evidence of radio@@ immuno@@ hist@@ ochem@@ istry ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with which it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with lacking until low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG level in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ tres a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 trial and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or minor neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if adverse drug reactions were typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the justification for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ sis , most likely via man@@ nose 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the medium phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement in lung function and ability to be able to follow in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung capacity increased propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / m@@ g. cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was detected , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous manifestation of the disease between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five active efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test , range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one year open phase 2 study was conducted , in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe form of exp@@ ir@@ ation and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were noted after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of delay ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe delay @-@ form only limited or no progress was to be detected in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test were carried out .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with one @-@ off administration , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medication against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or spreads easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies than any therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent de@@ hydr@@ ation ) should be given before or after C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood is changed or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , dropped or the dose is reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the mean survival time of A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival times when it was administered by A@@ lim@@ ta compared with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each breakthrough bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dos@@ - sis is taken from the breakthrough bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell lung carcin@@ oma , except for the predomin@@ ant disc epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the pre@@ fixed dose and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose , dosage must be taken at least 5 doses of fol@@ ate and intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first pre@@ fixed dose and after each third handling cycle .
in patients who obtain p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge should be created before every donation , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ PT ) and al@@ anine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after the recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria are in line with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 Ble@@ eding .
if patients do not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped when in patients after 2 dose @-@ induc@@ ing , a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above compared to patients at age 65 , there was an increased side effects risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which exceed the dose @-@ adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - B@@ order and / or Tran@@ sam@@ ic values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and p@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ew , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the degree of 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ologic and non @-@ mat@@ ologic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with level 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were observed when pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all treated patients must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous taking of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients intended for treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients who performed these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , premature blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion is considered before the treatment of p@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed treatment .
5 primary cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally if this substance is usually administered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive capacity by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out in front of the treatment - g@@ in to seek advice regarding sperm con@@ formation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can result in increased progression of P@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) use high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ am x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ aboli@@ c an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected in the pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , except if it is absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
given the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly damaging the reproductive capacity by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment begins to seek advice regarding sperm con@@ - tion .
it is not known whether mixed drinks are transferred to mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed - as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ised to random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 mixed @-@ mono@@ therap@@ i@@ estu@@ dia ( n = 16@@ 4 ) of phase 2 ( compared to 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ ge@@ tic 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve as well as significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .

serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ t and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in clinics with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
clinical studies occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ations , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) .
in clinical trials , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment with respiratory failure .
it was reported on cases of acute kidney failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their treatment ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fold that performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several targets by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cine am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients had a clin@@ ically meaningful advantage over medi@@ an 2.8 months prolonged survival compared to those patients with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and the worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC was followed by medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) of 7.@@ 9 months .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ disc epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6,@@ 2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study shows that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin over 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .

dissolve the content of the 100 mg capsules containing 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which results in a solution with a conc@@ entri@@ c ration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
dissolve the content of 500 mg / ml of sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which yields a solution with a conc@@ entri@@ c ration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
the resulting solution is clear and the coloring reaches from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the pro@@ - duc@@ t@@ quality .
it is used for obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats that have been supplied with the food without di@@ gest@@ ing the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 patients .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg per year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss was observed for patients .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ ia , stu@@ h@@ edge , o@@ ily / o@@ ily stools , ab@@ at@@ ement of o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant and / or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ isches , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data available for efficacy and safety .
however , as or@@ list@@ at is not resor@@ bed to minimal absorption , the dosage is not necessary in older people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous Treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ tation period ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dose of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended that additional anti @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be taken to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with concur@@ rent use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the use of or@@ list@@ at or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta carot@@ ene remain in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the gift of a one @-@ time dose of am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal in nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the frequency of known side effects noted after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
most of the cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported following the launch have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at can be traced back to a quick reg@@ ression .
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ remainder of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ tic li@@ ds .
from clinical studies , 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , was taken to block the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ us .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ isches , fatty diet .
the primary parameter , the change in the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline value of 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ c and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ l@@ ysi@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ cine group ) , could be identified in a study with obes@@ e patients that accounted for approximately 42 % of total plasma concentrations .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data cannot be seen as a danger to humans .

the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the start of treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet at this time .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally consume .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Dis@@ cover your recommended amount of fat evenly on the daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a high @-@ fat main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children in@@ accessible . • Do not store the medication after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cardboard box . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Sili@@ ca@@ gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
swallow it in no case . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories you are capable of is available from the information below , which indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the effect of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is critical .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .

alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of al@@ al@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent inhi@@ bits binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate vom@@ iting for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , moderate nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ ia showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsin@@ gen Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
alo@@ xi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ anine in the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can leng@@ then the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ ni@@ cal ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with concur@@ rent offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in cases where the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is said to be used for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity of the five chemotherapy drugs investigated ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ex concentration of oral meth@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous offering of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events associated with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar clusters of adverse events such as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy in an over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 m@@ g. of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given , which was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study 6@@ 67 patients who received strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and di@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out by 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. given Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous injection follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally throughout the dose range of 0.@@ 3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after the intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean mean in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer patients ran@@ ged from day 1 to day 5 ( ± SD ) in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations suggest that the total text position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to that after one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metaboli@@ sation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found in 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changeable substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
the total body values were 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects have only been observed after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance to clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicated that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ arization and can leng@@ then the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspond to about 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the announcement of the approval of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended with Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological remedy called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug as an effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a microsc@@ opic investigation , the liver tissue damages damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided the approval of the placing on the market ?
in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed did not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was more resistant to more patients than with the reference drug ; Al@@ ph@@ ema also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug develops an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ s ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for the treatment of infections that have been prov@@ ably caused or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ate Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
alt@@ ar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby obstruc@@ ts the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in dogs , approximately 90 % of patients in both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( jel@@ ly @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were prov@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the or@@ der@@ line .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were out@@ weigh@@ ed : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ s , abra@@ sions or se@@ wed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd Company a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes out and appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of infected open wounds the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deteri@@ oration occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ bition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ id skin of healthy adult males .
because of the low systemic exposure after topical application in patients , c@@ anned adap@@ tations are not necessary if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to be prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / stops or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / stops , it is advisable to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go used was the most commonly reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the administration site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of con@@ rod mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhi@@ bition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
binding to this binding site , hem@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ Transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms seem to be question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences were observed in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secon@@ dar@@ ily infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhi@@ bition .
metabolism of human liver micro@@ som@@ es in vitro was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , low involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , causing a up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ worn skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was determined .

for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ ization and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination existing from two doses has ended .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defence ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the vacc@@ ination registered since 1996 , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twin@@ rix Kinder .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ et adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix caused a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar in a six month and a 12 month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , with the first dose being administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a boo@@ ster of hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B is desired , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured that immun@@ of@@ lu@@ ent persons , who have appe@@ aled to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a re@@ fres@@ her creation as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in the case of no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vacc@@ ination , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with immune system disturbances , under certain circumstances there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be necessary .
because intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these injection methods should be avoided .
in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding can occur in these cases .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient on all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is possible .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ cker and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of the Ambi@@ rix vaccine were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the tolerance of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination impulse .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and dose based on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination @-@ impulse .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ ri@@ osis was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of those who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination @-@ vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination @-@ impulse with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vacc@@ ination , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ tious group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination @-@ vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent incidence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ inations that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination @-@ vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines aged 1 to including 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered for month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ation@@ - vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the serum levels ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 , after the administration of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ substance .
the immuno@@ responses that were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 year @-@ olds a month after ending the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) are listed in the table below .
in both studies , the ino@@ cul@@ ations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination @-@ vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies for at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination could be proven for people aged between 12 and 15 years .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was similar to those found following vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month vacc@@ ination scheme to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life coinci@@ des with the boo@@ sting of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after resor@@ ting to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the State Char@@ ge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is commonly transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways such as bathing in waters contaminated by sewage .
they may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a rapid protection against Hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you are taking other medicines / taking ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has received / has been given vacc@@ ination or immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has been planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , separate parts and as different limbs should be vacc@@ inated .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women is not administered , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ planted doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ iness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 t@@ inn@@ ed doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Fe@@ et @-@ feeling • ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
other side effects reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 s@@ im@@ ated doses ) are :
these include locally limited or extensive ra@@ inf@@ all , it@@ ching or bli@@ stering , swelling of the eye area and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and loss of consciousness .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic disease or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia - split by several individual doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a fake medication , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste version , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was permitted , because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this drug was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ est tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
for this reason , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma formation .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed menstru@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding times ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of the patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ectal patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old infant with an occasional single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
extern@@ ally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment will be started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative routes of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ es at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated prior to the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ est tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are rarely reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzyme with glut@@ amine , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury is created .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after single release as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and metaboli@@ tes were also studied in cancer patients based on sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dosing of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycle disorders or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies , after different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the medi@@ al phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury over the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either or@@ ally taken ( infants and children who do not have any tablets , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ est tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ tes of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) before the birth , it occurred to les@@ ions in the py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al cells of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ectal patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
extern@@ ally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess urine
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate used for each gram is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mercury @-@ nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are rarely reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur .

during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring sco@@ op contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring sco@@ op 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op , 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in case of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of chest pain with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients administered by a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox in any administration or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient is often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators except in severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other Hir@@ u@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the use of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous cle@@ av@@ age of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another row , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after the clinical needs .
an injection of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately prior to the intervention , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous cle@@ av@@ age of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a immediately followed intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an exclusive Bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second cle@@ av@@ age of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second cle@@ at dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second cle@@ at dose is to be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ Bol@@ us without a dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of untreated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hir@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disorder of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ agulation disorders . • Sever@@ e un@@ controlled hypertension and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • Sever@@ e kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
during the treatment , patients are carefully monitored with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though in PCI @-@ patients with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in arter@@ ial punc@@ tures , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ ona intervention ( PCI ) can perform bleeding during treatment .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ira , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after dis@@ continuation of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is again achieved prior to the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , these active ingredients may increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ bers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are to be monitored regularly in any case .
animal experimental studies are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ questioning He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the bi@@ val@@ ira group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both mild and heavy hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were significantly less frequent than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point of point , radi@@ ological or surgical intervention ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known bleeding point , reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding @-@ loc@@ ali@@ zations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point @-@ points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI .
both in the bi@@ val@@ ira group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as patients over 65 years of age were more frequent in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and heavy hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were significantly less frequent than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system categories in table 6 .
in the case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te inhibit@@ or which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion belt region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in liquid phase or cl@@ ot@@ ting .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine to thro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , slowly divi@@ des the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine was unable to indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine displays a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI has been performed in the patient below , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ira should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or administered as permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or not effectively process insulin .
insulin lu@@ c@@ sin differs very slightly from the acting insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot operate insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was reduced compared to a 0.@@ 14 % decrease in insulin li@@ sp@@ ro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after 6 months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ c@@ sin or any of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may have to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or del@@ to@@ id muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the abdom@@ en area .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of the active ingredient , the brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ arded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the amount of insulin .
3 An insufficient dose or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
among the substances that increase the blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disc@@ op@@ y@@ ects , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sper@@ mat@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , sympath@@ ies such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine can be allevi@@ ated or missing the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin relating to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ c@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use .
the results reported from clinical studies are listed , group@@ ed according to system categories and ordered after decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is neglected to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a su@@ itably trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
following a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ onal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin lu@@ c@@ sin occurs faster and the duration of active insulin is shorter than with normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ - tus , insulin lu@@ c@@ sin showed a dose @-@ proportional glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ately increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ c@@ sin has a twice as fast effect as normal Human insulin and achieves the full glucose @-@ healing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin lu@@ c@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved like with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ c@@ sin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ c@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved like with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ c@@ sin administered 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ c@@ sin administered 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
