<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Authorities Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the drug application.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or its treatment, please read the package insert (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inhaling (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl thought and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which patients alternate manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have used the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased disturbance or behavioural disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulties swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells through neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells among each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be the "partial agitator" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters, works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, involving 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to take-up.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented more effective recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients as placebo for up to 74 weeks and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ambilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo, the symptoms increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances, tremor (tremor), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (distipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mostly had manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes continued to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the board came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased disturbance and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing authorisation of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased dose of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient population, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder did not have an increased risk of suicide in comparison with other antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiac diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, ablysis), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerious and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with ambilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events involving Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydips, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to combination abilities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, respectively an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolizers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered jointly with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in aripiprazolate concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of aripiprazl per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethylorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the lack of data on humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies, unless the potential use justifies the potential risk for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against operating dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole does not have any negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total decreased incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14,8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients taking Olancers therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder: in a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients with aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients with placebo-treated patients was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl, compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence also reported in treatment with Aripiprazole, include the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since launch unintentionally or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is of benefit in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma rate retention.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D 2 and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D 2 and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to dopamine D, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the treatment of Aripiprazl in dosages from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C raclloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the caudatus nucleus and on the putstream.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study in week 52 the proportion of respondents who contributed to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales, which were defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depressionsrates scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olancer controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly less patients an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for over 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole versus placebo showed no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Furthermore, in week 12, Aripiprazl showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyling of Aripiprazl, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean exclusion period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl in extensive metabolites about CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-based effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A link-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity affiliation or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) did not show any significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, pre-clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigmentation-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate-metabolites of Aripiprazl in the Galle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate-conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazl found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- Aripiprazl were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">Rabbits were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3 and 11 times the middle Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimise the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended while bypassing obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicine used for conservation or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazl, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiac diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, ablysis), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerious and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydips, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to combination abilities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after allocating Aripiprazl, in a study where healthy volunteers of Aripiprazl (15 mg dose) were used as one-off intramuscularly and who received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, however, this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites, in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after allocating Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with placebo and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl, compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Among the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence also reported in treatment with Aripiprazole, include the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant higher improvements of agility / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms of agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement of the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score for the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study in week 52 the proportion of respondents who contributed to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and Haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales, which were defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-Depressionsrates range, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a significantly higher return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olancer controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms which were partially not on lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazl AUC was 90% greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- or 5 times over the maximum humanoid exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application no safety-related concerns arose after maternal exposure that was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humanoid exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, pre-clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects have been observed only in doses or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans; they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">Effects included dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Also, cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the Galle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">Rabbits were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11-times the mid-steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters earlier had received anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only those who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference in regard to efficacy indicators such as time until disease worsening and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be used in patients who have low blood rates in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The CHMP Committee established that Abraxane was more effective than conventional Paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other paclitaxel in order to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (number of neutrophes &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">At sensory neuropathy level 3 treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached at Grade 1 or 2, and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound Nanoparticle formulation from Paclitaxel, which could have substantially different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients, no new abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophes rose to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity has not been proven with Abraxane, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If patients with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in patients with the gift of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetics and constipating means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used for pregnant women or in childbearing age who do not practice an effective contraception, unless the mother's treatment with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to have no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm conformation before treatment, as the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very often) and dizziness (often) that can affect the transport ability and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abraxane in the pivotal phase III clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was rapidly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 contains the side effects performed in conjunction with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in the gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flange pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very often:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive account in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimations of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubuli active substance that promotes the accumulation of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin transcytosis of plasma components is mediated into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of Paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminreceptor and due to the albuminant protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single-arm unobstructed studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given intravenously over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg. / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer for over 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg. / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 229) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 megastasestellen.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy first, 27% had only an adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastazation and 19% for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 Results of the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy level 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for baseline decay due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions by Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the IV administration of Abraxane on patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high volume of distribution points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg. / m2 of solvent containing Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane gift (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher with Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine excretion was 4% of the total dose associated with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was verified at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic agent, and as with other potentially toxic substances, caution should be avoided when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile sprayer slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane breakthrough bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After a complete encore of the solution, the plug-in bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the plug-in bottle should be slowly and carefully lubricated and / or inverted until a complete reset of the powder is performed.</seg>
<seg id="329">If malformations or sprains are visible, the breakthrough bottle has to be gently inverted to achieve complete resuspension before application.</seg>
<seg id="330">The total dose of the 5 mg / ml-suspension necessary for the patient is calculated and the corresponding quantity of the reconstituent Abraxane is injected into an empty, sterile PVC- or non-PVC infusion bag.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packaging inserts. • With clear visual representation of the correct use of the product, cooling boxes for transport are provided by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same drug (also called "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-blood values, in which complications could occur in connection with a blood transfusion in case a blood donation is not possible before the intervention and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed needs to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be monitored prior to the treatment to ensure that iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by erythropoietine deficiency or because the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">When administered as an injection in a vein, Abseamed was compared with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected with Eprex / Erypo in a vein for at least eight weeks before receiving either elamed or still receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period during the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of cutted Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were studied in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to seamed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that for Abseamed, according to the regulations of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile, such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medice medicinal Pütter GmbH & Co KG a permit for the placing of Abseamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma, which includes chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger surgical interventions that require large blood volume compensation (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of third-party blood, Abseamed can be used in front of a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, where a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in a autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and results may vary depending on age, gender, and overall disease; therefore, the doctor requires the assessment of the individual clinical condition and condition of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin instability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa-dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest legal dose required for the control of anaemia and anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia which is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia which is less severe (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.E. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.E. / kg (three times per week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia symptoms and - follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease load; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical condition and condition of disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin instability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest legal dose required to control anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the hemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticululoid count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be maintained once a week, 150 I.E. / kg once a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Reticululoid numbers &lt; 40,000 cells / µl are increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg three times a week of the hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticuloidal number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the hemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticululoid number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, an indication of the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), where the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, Abseamed received a dose of 600 I.E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program started, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the seamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively charged 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from the treatment with any erythropoetin at an erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive any streamed or any other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in a autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escort or underlying disease: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carcinoid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recent heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effects, defined as a reduction in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulotic value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiuminous intoxication, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the label is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocytes numbers are normal, and if no other reason for a loss of action is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibody should be determined and an examination of the bone marks for diagnosing a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk for an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the application of epoetins when the hemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration required for the control of the anaemia-symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should amount to 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary artery disease or congestive insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with kidney failure, which is not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients with chemotherapy a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin response should be considered for the evaluation of epoetin alfa (patients who may have to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb-value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l) is exceeded, the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of Patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the participation of each patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to the onset of epoetin alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing greater elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial outpatient value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or decrease the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l) was sought</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood level of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose should be adjusted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of interactions between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis and 11 blood clots in artificial kidney were reported in patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common adverse effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the erythropogenic treatment.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can occur after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including patients who have recently suffered a low-traumatic hip fracture like falling down; • Disease Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fractures should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (agent against inflammation) shortly after the use of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis for over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip fracture; the number of fractures was studied over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two trials involving 357 patients and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spine fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture 9% of the patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Acella may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoledron acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonekrose (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta manufacturer provides information for physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information on how to use the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • Contract contraindication in pregnancy and nursing women • Required a proper intake of calcium and vitamin D, adequate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When on medical or nursing aid is available</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently litte low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After the treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long remission was observed in patients who responded to therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the use of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see Section 4.4) In patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and young people Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Acella is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with a sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">A temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia, which occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8), can develop because of the fast implementation of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, oral hygiene should be performed prior to treatment of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the use of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of serious side effects reported by atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal function Zoledron acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which were associated with kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually prior to administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8% of the patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values that were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l) occurred, at 2.3% of the patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of the patients treated with Aclasta in the patients with Morbus-Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">In addition, all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently fractured hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but most patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteochecrosis in the jaw area was observed, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledrononic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in the field of an aclasta and placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged 65 to 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the enkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric level fractures Aclasta significantly lowered over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta treated patients of 75 years and over had a 60% reduction in the risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta had an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on the lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to the placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the femoral neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies were taken from the basin comb.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison with placebo, a microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5-mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to baseline value and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The overall survival was 10% (101 patients) in the placebo-treated group compared to 13% (141 patients).</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, in comparison to placebo treatment, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD on the total and thighs at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment to increase BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% at the enkelhal.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once-weekly administration of Aclasta compared to the weekly dose of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radiological confirmed, above all mild to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of the alkaline phosphatase correspondingly to the 2,6x to 3.0fold age-specific upper normal value when taken into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 Effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Risedronate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month main study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients receiving aclasta and 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 of the patients treated with Risedronat could be maintained in the mean duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Five and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of coledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetical data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma levels quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value of 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long period of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life cycles of ½ a 0.24 and t ½ to 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early phases of distribution (α and β, with the aforementioned t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid absorption in bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zinc acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration versus time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearing of metabolized cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because they are a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, inhibitor inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function down to a creatinine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe renal function (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restrictive data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lal-acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC 6x of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application the renal tolerability of zoledron acid was administered in rats by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure relative to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">Long-term studies with repeated application in cumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure showed toxicological effects in other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in repeated use studies was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphor of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats followed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledrononic acid is a compound class agent called bisphosphonate and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens that are formed from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass which is observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of the Morbus Paget the bone structure becomes too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Authorities Report (EPAR) in which the study evaluated how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the drug application.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (particularly overweight patients), where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients), metformin can not be adequately adjusted in the highest acceptable dose with metformin alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyx resin or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonylurea or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the acetate treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulphonyl resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilised and the blood sugar level decreases, which means that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of acetin was studied in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyx resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced by doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the trial, the effect of an additional donation from Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyx resin in a reduction of HbA1c values was 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who additionally took account of insulin had lowered the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain, and hypothesisation (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must neither be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos ought to be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white until whitish, round, arched and carry on one side marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequately adjusted with insulin and is inappropriate for metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18 no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (e.g. early cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease) are at risk of developing a decompensated heart failure, the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing pharmacrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in the reports on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">Pioglitazone may not be used in patients with increased output hepatic cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit) or with other signs of liver disease.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be controlled as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overgrowth problems, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon should be conducted prior to the examination of the laboratory parameters by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A minor reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) was a result of hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematoprits by 3.1% and 1-2% relative reduction of haemoglobin by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who have pioglitazon as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyx resin or dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch it was reported in the treatment of thiazolite indices, including pioglitazone, an incidence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the incidence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report disturbances of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occured at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if one patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blockers and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC from Pioglitazon around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulin- and elevated insulin resistance of the mother's animal is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>

<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as seen in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT adpins over three times the upper limit of the standard range were similar to placebo but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyx resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency in Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pioglitazon, but more frequently when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazon and over 7,400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative medications.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occured at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of the patients treated with Pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to be an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It has been shown that pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy was continued over two years to study the time until the end of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by pioglitazon in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to those who continue to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decline in the albumin / Kreatinin ratio compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week investigation of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid reduced total plasmatglycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found under Pioglitazon, while impaired values were observed in Metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone did not only reduce the triglyceride level but also improved the post-flax increased triglyceride level, both via an effect on the triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease were randomized, who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, with the top concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma normally achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to the efficacy of about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) or with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the fences (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination lifetime of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours for humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral safety in the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies included mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulin- and elevated insulin resistance of the mother's animal is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindians led to increased frequency of colonic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occured at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / Kreatinine quotient showed a statistically significant decrease compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone did not only reduce the triglyceride level but also improved the post-flax increased triglyceride level, both via an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target of its primary endpoint, which showed a combination of total mortality, non-lethal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularisation and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane caused a decrease in the HbA1c level that indicated that blood sugar levels were similarly lowered as with a different human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Acetabane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actrophane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (see the full list of the package insert).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of actraphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes in relation to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S a permit for the placing of Actraphane in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="877">Before traveling, which go through several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor, as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>

<seg id="886">However, hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemia with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an unread help person or by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Disorders of the liver during Phase 3 clinical trials were observed with slight symptoms of liver function values in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the Febuxostats treatment and, depending on the clinical findings and a liver function test (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zein was not carried out interactions with Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to an increase in theophylline level (a inhibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous offering of Febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg twice daily associated with an increase in Febuxostat exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient applied at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x showed a mean 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that simultaneous intake of antazidum containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide inhibit the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in CMAx by 32%, but does not cause significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not leave side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal-experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction in serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of arthritis cases, so that less than 3% of patients needed treatment against gout in the months (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need any treatment against gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout nodes, which resulted in 54% of patients having a complete disappearance of the gutter nodes up to the month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µIU / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) by Febuxostat increased by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which is to take place at the earliest thirty minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After 15 weeks of treatment, patients with low vitamin D levels were lower (11%) compared to those treated with ADROVANCE (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, diarrhea (diarrhea), ulcers (ulcera), vomiting (ulcera), bloated abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as acidic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="1292">The doctor should alert attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be noted that symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn can stop the medicine and seek medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue to take on symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While there was no increased risk in large-scale clinical studies with alendronat, gastric and duodenal ulcers, including some severe and with complications, were rare (see Section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1301">Other diseases that affect the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronat before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day over five days) led to no clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies of rats yielded that Alendronate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after IV administration of 1 mg / kg, but is then rapidly redistributed to the bones or excreted into the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Elimination After the intravenous dose of a single dose of 14C-alendronate approximately 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the fences.</seg>

<seg id="1402">As tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already used in the EU, the company has submitted the results from previously carried out studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, compared to the application of advant with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after one year (for example, by examining how often a new organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter follow-up studies of 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant have been carried out and examined how advant is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1408">Patients and physicians must be cautious if others (especially some herbal) drugs are taken at the same time with advagraphs, since the Advantf dosage or the dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects including under- or superimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; rendition of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advantf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in the individual case and on blood level measurements (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">Following the changeover from Prograf to Advantf, the Tacrolimus tables should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks after adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the tacrolimus tables are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advantf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night-ransplantation period.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low-clearing substance, an adaptation of the Advantf dose scheme can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition is not oral in the first postoperative period, the intravenous tacrolimus therapy (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate can be initiated to produce an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advanagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose-adjustments may be required later, as the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus can change after the transplant is stabilised during the course of the patient's stabilization.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendation - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advanagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advantf must be changed from twice daily dose of Prograf Capsules to a once daily intake of Advantf, so this conversion has to be done at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant following a change from other immunosuppressants to advant once a day, the treatment must begin with the recommended oral dose recommended in the kidney and liver transplant for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">In adult patients, which are converted to advanagraphs, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients although there is no clinical experience with adventia in lung, pancreatic and colon grafted patients, patient Prograf was administered in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with pankreastral-transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose-adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level, a calculation of the creatine-index and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advantf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case using whole blood-tacrolimus-talc controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent checks of the tacrolimus tables during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled following conversion from Prograf to advant, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or concurrent use of substances which could change the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advantf is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the sebum in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the sebum of tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplants usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and garnish - and transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur in a sequence of tacrolimus differences or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; rendition of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the close control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have been shown to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients in childhood, no clinical data are available for the retarded formulation of Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and weakening the clinical effect of tacrolimus, taking herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) can be avoided, or other herbal remedies during a treatment with advant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the tacrolimus blood levels under such circumstances may be subject to considerable fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf there was an anterior or septum-hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy which can therefore occur under Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients take tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g..</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advantf hard capsules, retarded, lactose are contained, particular caution is given in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while offering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain consistent concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was done with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the rise in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal transit.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as it is used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 may affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal expositions, decisions about contraceptive measures should be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus may potentially reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazon and extend their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies on transplant patients do not indicate that under tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (particularly in terms of its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases As known to other highly effective immunosuppressants, patients who are treated with tacrolimus are often increased susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of BCs-virus-associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with advant.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasma including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors combined with tacrolimus therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high bond to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, Tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effects of tacrolimus may be mediated by binding to a cytosolite protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent inhibiting of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on the T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound faction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion mainly takes place via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf for stable patients treated with Prograf (once daily) in the ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application is based on whether advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced using a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Recombinate, but is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years of age, the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new antiseptics with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the launch of Advate in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years), until the danger for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, a reasonable determination of the factor VIII plasma gas is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities is not reached or if the bleeding with a proper dose is not controlled, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitory values it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The speed of passage should be directed after finding the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the prokoagulatory activity of Factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) pro ml plasma by modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 positioning days and anamnestic known inhibitory development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII-product to another, the recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs used in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients) who had a higher risk of inhibiting inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the total of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop of the blood coagulation factor VIII was postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VIII- mirrors in plasma as well as the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient with ADVATE showed a low inhibitortiter (2,4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor was detected.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients in a current clinical trial consisted of 5 of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant uptrend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell proteins, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that showed an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes was reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited distributed the CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the advent of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to reform the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene present in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, in which Li-Fraumeni cancer appeared in the area of the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers of the company to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin injections in Li-Fraumeni Tumors benefit patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company did not have sufficient evidence that advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"" "the company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal had consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or" "" "passionate-use" "" "programs with advexin." ""</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified substance release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, an allergy to pollen caused inflammation of the nose pathways) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clung.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be relieved on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients recorded their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, patients who received aemia reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received lost medication alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (somnolence), sleeping disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should not be used in patients suffering from conjunctival glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrophy), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrophy) or a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the transport of aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to be swallowed whole (i.e. without biting, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under the age of 12.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms cease.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within the 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, lisurid, Cabergoline, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestosis which can be performed pertinally or nasally as swab of Rhino (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective and the data did not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aAerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data did not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that the treatment must be stopped when a hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (like headache or strengthening the headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Caution is advised when treating the following patient groups: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck and bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is present at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with chloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of descalatadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with deschloratadin and placebo, regardless of whether or not alcohol was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the loratadin enzyme has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Chloratadin does not block CYP3A4 in vivo, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not reveal any increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, it should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a dizziness which can lead to impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible abdominal operations.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness, increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil stiffness and - dilation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectins on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg no longer showed any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective anxiety or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further likeable effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis took part, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determined by means of the total duration for the symptoms (except nose mucous swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucous swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with descalatadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity belonging to patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetic of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the pertinent application of aerinaze for healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test persons were badly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was equivalent to exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desertification does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination did not possess any greater toxicity than its single components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation, the pharmaceutical covigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1707">20 Under certain circumstances, you may be particularly sensitive to the mucous membrane of Pseudoephedrine, which is contained in this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">(diabetes), a leading stomach ulcer (ulcer that leads to narrowing of stomach, small intestine or oesophagus), a closure of the stomach outlet or the duodenum, a bladder neck injury, bronchospasm in the patient's history (shortness of breath due to a cramp of lung muscles), a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver, kidneys or bladder.</seg>
<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you have the following symptoms or diseases when using Aerinaze: • Blood blood pressure • heart chase, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache, or strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aerofaze with other medicines, inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Airtightness and the use of machines If the recommended dosage is applied, it is not to be expected that aerinaze leads to lightheadedness or decreases the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take Aerinaze If you forgot to take a dose in good time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart chase, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleeping disorders, nervousness and dizziness.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias, increased physical activity, redness, heat waves, confusion, blurred vision, dry eyes, nasal bleeding, nasal irritation, stomach upset, nausea, nausea, chills, reduction of the sense of smell, abnormal liver strains, anxiety, anxiety and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadin, severe allergic reactions (breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rashes were reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chases, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pains, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of hepatitis and cases of conspicuous liver impairments were also very rare reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilia for inhalation (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for accepting.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1,25 mg once daily, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or 5 ml of syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by investigating the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrants, difficulty of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to take and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptoms (the number of symptoms) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decline in symptoms was followed after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in the placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, loratadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the placing of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience in clinical trials on the effectiveness of the use of disloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should take place according to the previous disease process and may be terminated after the termination of the symptoms and resumed during their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persisting allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not established in clinical trials with chloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to light that can lead to impairment of transportation or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials of different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with Aerius than in those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported in placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical study involving 578 young patients aged 12 to 17 was the most common adverse event of headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with deschloratadin and in 6.9% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study in which up to 45 mg of descalatadin (nine-phase clinical dose) were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin on Endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses given in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which chloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-time of the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg no longer showed any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective anxiety or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the total quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of the urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, despite the etiology of the different forms, is similarly refractive and chronic patients can be recruited more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of histamine is a causative factor in all urticular diseases, it is expected that in addition to the chronically idiopathic urticaria, it is also possible to improve the symptoms in other forms of urticaria. this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrants at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with anti-histamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the rate of itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of the placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient-demographics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of desertification was achieved in 4% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the loratadin, however, has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo, chloratadin does not block CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desertification in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) had no effect on the availability of loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with the laucomatadin and lauatadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desertification does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colorless film (contains lactose-monohydrate, hypromabrasion, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromabrasion, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see Section 4.4) and that no data exists which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the influenza of avian H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily be spread by humans to humans because people have not yet built up immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies quickly in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as alien) is cleaned up, purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">The scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in participating in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also included in the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for use, but this cannot be taken together with ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Generalase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out what antiviral drugs the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is calculated according to the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">When taking in combination with other antiviral medicines, it reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, may delay damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Aging was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without the ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The medicine used with low dose ritonavir was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults, earlier protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Ageneric ase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults that had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine used with ritonavir extracts the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase along with ritonavir to a stronger deterioration of the viral load after four weeks as in patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">It may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are degraded just like aging, and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take aging are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of aging in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat protease inhibitors outweigh the risks of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Generic ase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of aging in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "generic ase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of gas in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Aging is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, amulase capsules for pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir can be administered together with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to take-in is reduced by 14% less than by amprenavir than capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily together with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. if Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Aging is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of agglomerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">It may not be given at the same time using medicines which have low therapeutic widths and may also present substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the use of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that aging or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asgenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Ageneric ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal disease progression.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant medical information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with preexisting reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and simvastatin depends on CYP3A4, concurrent administration with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (controlled by the International Regulated Ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these drugs at the same time, amitase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is also given with amprenavir at the same time, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opitism, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the asgenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Generalase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses related to their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer-lasting antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Hemophilic patients (type A and B) who were treated with protease inhibitors are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial eology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude must not be given at the same time using medicines which have low therapeutic widths and are also substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir may not be given together with medicines, whose active ingredients are metabolized mainly via CYP2D6 and for increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir leading to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In attempting to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were frequently observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels are and, if possible, to check the viral load and depose the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nelly finavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">By contrast, 508% increases for CMAX by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials dosages of 600 mg of amprenavir have been used twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliates if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous application of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a tight monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study on the use of agressis in combination with didanosin is not carried out, but due to the antazion component of didanosin it is recommended that the intakes of didanosine and agglomerase are at least one hour apart (see antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in the case of Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous application of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dose of Rifabutin will be reduced to at least half the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with azithromycin in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-O) once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may, if applied together with aging, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs, if they are used in combination with aging.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as generalase since it can result in resorption dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzymatic ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipin, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil may be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent intake with agglomerase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbance and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluorosonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous application of aging with ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolization is highly dependent on CYP3A4, marked increases in plasma levels can be expected at the same time as aphorase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma level increases in these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may lead to myopathy, including a rhdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased concurrently with amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, alase may not be used together with orally recorded midazolam (see Section 4.3), while applying parenteral Midazolam with parenteral Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicates a possible rise in midazolam plasma levels by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered with amprenavir together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opitism, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation of how to adjust the amprenavirus dose if amprenavir is simultaneously administered with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With concurrent offering of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with aging, an increased control of INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not foreseeable, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended concurrently with a generalase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the possible benefits to the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the lactation rats, amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the pickup in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding time amprenavir, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of aging was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the aging treatment were mild until moderately pronounced, occurred early and rarely led to treatment abruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are related to taking asgenerase or any other medicine used at the same time as HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive pre-treated patients 1200 mg of Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) assessed by investigators as related to study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and faetal adipose tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorso-cervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated subjects treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (breastfeeding) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, patients with 245 NRTI- treated patients with amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or lean nature, with or without itching and usually occured during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice daily together with low dosed ritonavir (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed in patients who received agenerase along with low dosed ritonavir, were very common.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the case of overdosing, the patient is to be observed at signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures must be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gene and gag polarity reversal stages with the result of an unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro v. HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitory (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range from 0,012 to 0,08 µM at acutely infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as in other ritonavir-patterned treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the mutations described rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral unpretreated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children, in which virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, I4V, I5V, I62V, I42A / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62A / I, I84V, I84V, I84V, I84V, I84V, I84V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and their prolongation APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients with protease inhibitors performed more than 96 weeks in patients with virological failure, following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypical evaluation systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic evaluation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with the genotypical data for estimating the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these genetic patterns with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain degree of cross resistance against ritonavir, sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir Resistenzaids, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral unpretreated patients, in which a resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), diningavir / ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), equinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates) seem to cause.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor insulates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early failure of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations, which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of aging in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the PRO30017 study, a randomized open study, in which patients treated with PI (100 mg twice daily) and nuclear therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in terms of time-adjusted average change from baseline (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-inferior threshold of 0.4 to 10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asgenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 had been pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, doses of 15 mg / kg were taken three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with aging.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell counts of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefit of" "" "unbleached" "" "asterase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">By contrast, 508% increased for CMAX by 30% if ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake impacted the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines which induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or present a CYP3A4 substrate must be administered cautiously if given at the same time using asgenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to similar daily amprenavir exposure, as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bio-availability than from the capsules; therefore, the agglomerase solution and agglomerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of renal function on the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemas lead to amprenavir plasmasons comparable to those achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without concurrent scheduling of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas were observed in doses that corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>

<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">To date, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during administration or after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies in young animals treated at 4 days age showed a high mortality in both the control animals and in the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24. if Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (controlled by the International Regulated Ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available.</seg>

<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and related metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir leading to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">By contrast, 508% increases for CMAX by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous application of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a tight monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dose of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose may be 31, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipin, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, Nicardipin, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluorosonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With concurrent offering of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with aging, an increased control of INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous application of ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin by amprenavir by 22% or less.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro v. HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibitory (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range from 0,012 to 0,08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor insulates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, treatment optimisation in the treatment of PI pre-treated children should be considered the expected benefits of "unbleached" asterase.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, medicines which induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or present a CYP3A4 substrate must be administered cautiously if given at the same time using asgenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimodine cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of imiquimodine cream related side effects include complaints at the location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by 185 with Imiquimodine-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of phase III are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, perhaps, or perhaps associated with the application of imiquimodine cream, were in these studies a response to the location (22% of the patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimodine-cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">According to the protocol, this placebo-controlled trial evaluated clinical signs that in this placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimodine cream frequently went to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excrement / skaters (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan, assessment of the clinical signs indicated that in these studies, with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine cream, severe erythema (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe snoring and sticking (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the treatment of Imiquimodine for the treatment of the actin Keratose, alopecia was found with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental one-time oral absorption of 200 mg imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 phase-relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cowards during an Imiquimodine treatment is significantly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the patients treated with Imiquimodine the patients were completely cured; this was the case at 20% of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimodine treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of Imiquimodine for five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed individual primary super-artificial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimodine in one or two weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week treatment period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic acts within a related 25 cm2 area of treatment on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">For paediatric patients, paediatric patients usually do not follow the approved indications, actin Keratose and Superficial basal cell carcinoma and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies at the dosages that were studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% Imiquimodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of the serum in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were reported in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated apparent half-life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2hrs half-life time after subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the absorption of imiquimodine after topical application on MC-diseased skin in patients aged 6 to 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or super-functional basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month trial for dermal toxicity at rat rates, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg are significantly reduced body weight and increased Milz weight; a study carried out for four months for dermal application resulted in no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice in dermal administration of three days a week did not induce tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine has only a low system absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low as a result of systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the non-active cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you do. − If any of the listed side effects have significantly affected you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - so early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actin Keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people exposed to exposure to sunlight during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should be applied only with flat actinic keratosis in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actin Keratose or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>

<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with genital warts in the genital area, treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) is done.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeeding your baby during treatment with Aldara cream is not known, since it is not known whether imiquimodine occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different at seiswarts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Put a thin layer of Aldara cream on the clean, dry skin place with the skins and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area (see section 2, "What do you have to consider before using Aldara Cream?").</seg>

<seg id="2265">A low number of blood cells may cause you more prone to infection; it can cause you to create a blue stain quickly or cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you may experience itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Aldara cream (8% of the patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">It is usually the case of lighter skin reactions that end up within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment has been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, snoring, dermatitis, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application area (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, shame, or flu-like symptoms, depression, eye irritation, swelling of the eyelids, redness, facial swelling, ulcer, artery pain, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitational equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect in the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">At the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal sized liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever and reactions to the infusion location.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be disclosed each year, possibly updating this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme is used to treat patients who receive aldurazyms concerning the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovvary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in patients with kidney or hepatic insufficiency has not been determined, and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect associated with infusion or until the end of the infusion session (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, virtually all patients may form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with care when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer interval, the risk of hypersensitivity after an interruption of the treatment has to be cautiously advised due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting the infusion with medication (Antihistaminika and / or Antipyescu) to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or medium-severe infusion-induced reaction, the treatment should be considered with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-induced reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be re-recorded with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or procain, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular image of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data in newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly reported as infusion-related responses, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and lengthening in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are shown in the following table below: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in previous history, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory condition and facial edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug interactions with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with the predominance of severe expiration and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients underwent a seroconversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a severe disease in patients aged under 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until a premature expiration from the study), there were no evidence of radioimmunohistochemistry (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with which it never came to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacking until low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG level in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titres a variable reduction of GAG was detected in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 trial and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal or minor neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if adverse drug reactions were typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The justification for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysis, most likely via mannose 6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the medium phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the total distance in the 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement in lung function and ability to be able to follow in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung capacity increased proportionally to the size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg. creatinin) was detected, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous manifestation of the disease between the patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five active efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute hearing test, range of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one year open phase 2 study was conducted, in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetic of Aldurazyme was examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe form of expiration and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were noted after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of delay (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe delay-form only limited or no progress was to be detected in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different Aldurazyme dosage schemes on the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and 6-minute hearing test were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available, rate annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with one-off administration, toxicity with repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, pre-clinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies than any therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with Cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent dehydration) should be given before or after Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, dropped or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetremixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural othelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the mean survival time of Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients in which cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells showed longer survival times when it was administered by Alimta compared with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each breakthrough bottle must be dissolved with 4,2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml), which results in a 25 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dos- sis is taken from the breakthrough bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-small bronchial carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma, except for the predominant disc epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion for 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² of KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of KOF is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the prefixed dose and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose, dosage must be taken at least 5 doses of folate and intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first prefixed dose and after each third handling cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who obtain pemetremixed, a complete hemorrhage should be created before every donation, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGPT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place taking into account the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria are in line with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 Bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients do not develop-hematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be stopped when in patients after 2 dose-inducing, a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above compared to patients at age 65, there was an increased side effects risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which exceed the dose-adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- Border and / or Transamic values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marrow immunosuppression and pemetraxed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neutrophils again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophew, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of the degree of 3 / 4 hematologic and non-matologic toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with level 3 / 4 neutropenia were observed when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all treated patients must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for the reduction of treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous taking of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients intended for treatment with pemetremixed must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who performed these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, premature blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, drainage of the effusion is considered before the treatment of pemetraxed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 primary cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with pemetremixed occasionally if this substance is usually administered in combination with a different cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage of the reproductive capacity by means of pemetremixed, men should be pointed out in front of the treatment - gin to seek advice regarding sperm conformation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g per day) can result in increased progression of Pemetraxed excretion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) use high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetremixed avoided (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life like Piroam xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application of Pemetremixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regulated Ratio), when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetraxed in pregnant women, but as with anabolic antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetraxed should not be used during pregnancy, except if it is absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Given the possibility of irreversibly damaging the reproductive capacity by means of pemetremixed, men should be advised before the treatment begins to seek advice regarding sperm con- tion.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether mixed drinks are transferred to mother's milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic antifold that performs its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetremixed acts as an anti-folate with several targets by blocking the thyme dylatynthase (DHFR) and glycine amidribonucleotide myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleural othelioma showed that patients had a clinically meaningful advantage over median 2.8 months prolonged survival compared to those patients with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2501">Dissolve the content of 500 mg / ml of sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml) without preservatives, which yields a solution with a concentric ration of about 25 mg / ml of pemetremixed.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The resulting solution is clear and the coloring reaches from colourless to yellow or greenish, without compromising the pro- ductquality.</seg>
<seg id="2503">It is used for obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low-calorie, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should consult their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they can not break down some fats in the food, causing about a quarter of the fats that have been supplied with the food without digesting the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo in 391 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg per year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss was observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on the anus, flatus (winch) with stuhlabia, stuhedge, oily / oily stools, abatement of oily secretion (fences), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It must also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract) or to cholestase (liver disease), and pregnant and / or nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of orlistat GSK across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalisches, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data available for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, as orlistat is not resorbed to minimal absorption, the dosage is not necessary in older people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simultaneous Treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Pretation period (see Section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting treatment with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dose of these drugs needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended that additional anti-contraceptive measures should be taken to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with concurrent use of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the use of orlistat or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (international normal-ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the levels of vitamins A, D, E and K and the beta carotene remain in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplement of the multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the gift of a one-time dose of amiodarone, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal in nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), and very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects noted after the market launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Most of the cases of orlistat overdose reported following the launch have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on humans and animals, any systemic effects caused by orlistat can be traced back to a quick regression.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect consists in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-remainder of the gastric and pankretic lids.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies, 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, was taken to block the absorption of about 25% of the food fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalisches, fatty diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in the body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3,5% with orlistat (baseline value of 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (starting value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be sporadic and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysized Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl-Leucine group), could be identified in a study with obese patients that accounted for approximately 42% of total plasma concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, pre-clinical data cannot be seen as a danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules, resulting in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the start of treatment, as you may not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize the diet-related accompanying symptoms: • Begin already a few days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally consume.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Discover your recommended amount of fat evenly on the daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal, not to take them in the form of a high-fat main dish or a substantial dessert, as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies that are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of alalxi can be increased by adding a Corticosteroids (a medicine used as an anti-emetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent inhibits binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate vomiting for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, moderate nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with alopia showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsingen Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alanine in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can lengthen the colon massage, patients with anamnical obstipation or signs of subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised with concurrent offering of Palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in cases where the Qt interval is extended or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois is said to be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not inhibit tumor activity of the five chemotherapy drugs investigated (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetical interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-stex concentration of oral methoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous offering of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (amimetidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, so Palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events associated with a dose of 250 micrograms were headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar clusters of adverse events such as in other dosage groups; there were no dose-effects relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to the large distribution volume a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy in an overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg. of dolasetron (half-life time 4 hours) or 100 mg of dolasetron (half-life time 7.3 hours) were given, which was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study 667 patients who received strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and diacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarisation and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v. given Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous injection follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosed proportionally throughout the dose range of 0.3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After the intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean mean in 11 testicular cancer patients ranged from day 1 to day 5 (± SD) in the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations suggest that the total text position (AUC0- ∞) achieved at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to that after one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg of measured value; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found in 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unchangeable substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The total body values were 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min after a unique intravenous bolus injection.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects have only been observed after expositions, which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies indicated that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular De- and Repolarization and can lengthen the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose correspond to about 30x of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the high dosages used and since Alois is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the announcement of the approval of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended with Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological remedy called Roferon-A with the same drug as an effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damages damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed did not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was more resistant to more patients than with the reference drug; Alphema also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug develops an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of impetigo (skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirs (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for the treatment of infections that have been provably caused or probably caused by methicillinate Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby obstructs the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in dogs, approximately 90% of patients in both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (jelly-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were provably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the orderline.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were outweighed: • Impetigo, • infected small infirs, abrasions or sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd Company a permit for the placing of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered an alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Saline, the treatment should be canceled, the ointment carefully wipes out and appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of infected open wounds the efficacy of Retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on skimmed skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% retapamulin Salbe on skid skin of healthy adult males.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Because of the low systemic exposure after topical application in patients, canned adaptations are not necessary if topical Retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Saline should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin to be preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / stops or the therapy with Altargo continues / stops, it is advisable to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo used was the most commonly reported side effect of irritation at the administration site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effect Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of conrod mutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding to this binding site, hemromutiline inhibits the PeptidylTransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal education of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of Retapamulin at least some infection forms seem to be questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were observed in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin against S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus, strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Saline was applied daily under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin Saline twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondarily infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to the medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the reapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism of human liver microsomes in vitro was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, low involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro investigation on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats microkernel test for in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, causing a up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 sworn skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-times estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the marketing authorization is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan as described in the version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not explicitly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be used in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointments are on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination existing from two doses has ended.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defence), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same constituents as the vaccination registered since 1996, Twinrix Adults and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twinrix Kinder.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinet adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children, who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix caused a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar in a six month and a 12 month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matchiness (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with Ambirix is made up of two doses, with the first dose being administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster of hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B is desired, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccines can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same order as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured that immunofluent persons, who have appealed to hepatitis A vaccination, need a refresher creation as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in the case of no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccination, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemodialysis patients and persons with immune system disturbances, under certain circumstances there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impact, these injection methods should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be administered subcutaneous as an intramuscular administration of bleeding can occur in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measles mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient on all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thicker and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 doses of the Ambirix vaccine were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the tolerance of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose-combination impulse.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and dose based on a calculation basis per vaccination Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3-dose-combination-impulse.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Matriosis was comparable to per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of those who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose-combination-vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and matchiness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination-impulse with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vaccination, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambitious group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose-combination-vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent incidence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccinations that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination-vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccines aged 1 to including 15 years, serum conversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered for month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination- vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the serum levels (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with Ambirix in the month 2 and 6, after the administration of the 3-dose-substance.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunoresponses that were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 year-olds a month after ending the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7) are listed in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the inoculations received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination-vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and Anti-HBs antibodies for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination could be proven for people aged between 12 and 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was similar to those found following vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6- month vaccination scheme to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life coincides with the boosting of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resorting to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>
<seg id="2773">According to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC, the State Charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2778">They may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccine), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix, or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest through itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a rapid protection against Hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before ending the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected with people suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defences, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you are taking other medicines / taking (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has recently been vaccinated / has received / has been given vaccination or immunoglobulins (antibodies) or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, separate parts and as different limbs should be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix pregnant or breastfeeding women is not administered, unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please tell your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very frequent (more than 1 case per 10 implanted doses): • Pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Matiness • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been known since issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in traffic only in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzymatic disease or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia - split by several individual doses to the meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomy hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach-leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a fake medication, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste version, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "under" "" "exceptional circumstances," "" "ammonia was permitted, because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this drug was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzymatic defect that manifests itself after the first months of life), there is an indication for use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein intolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniest transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatynthetase deficiency must obtain arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagus ulcera, if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">For this reason, AMMONAPS should be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and edema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous formulation of phenylacetate in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in a slowdown of neural propagation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed menstruation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding times (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of the patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectal patient who developed metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an occasional single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylmercury glutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Externally, phenylacetylmercury is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylmercury is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of biased sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylacetylmercury-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment will be started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the exploitation of alternative routes of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newbores at postpartal (but within the first life-month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated prior to the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy was the survival rate of 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the orniest transcarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are rarely reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzyme with glutamine, where phenylacetylmercury is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis after single release as well as repetitive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">Phenylbutyrate and metabolites were also studied in cancer patients based on sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dosing of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cycle disorders or hemoglobin opathies, after different doses phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenylacetate in plasma was detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the medial phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylmercury over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrate was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules are either orally taken (infants and children who do not have any tablets, or patients with difficulty swallowing) or a gastrostomy or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniest transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolites of phenylbutyrate) before the birth, it occurred to lesions in the pyramidal cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectal patient who developed metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Externally, phenylacetylmercury is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylmercury is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess urine</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylmercury in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyrate used for each gram is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylacetylmercury-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are rarely reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dosing of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring scoop contains 0.95 g, the average measuring scoop 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop, 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine through a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so they can't excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS because the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, tracking of the ear, disorientation, memory problems and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were also observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, please contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of initiating the appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in case of unstable angina (a form of chest pain with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measured value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients administered by a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox in any administration or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient is often a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - was as effective in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, angiox was as effective as heparin in terms of all indicators except in severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other Hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the use of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-raising infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous cleavage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another row, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after the clinical needs.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An injection of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately prior to the intervention, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous cleavage of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a immediately followed intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an exclusive Bolus administration of angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second cleavage of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolus dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second cleat dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second cleat dose is to be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the bivalira-Bolus without a dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous administration of untreated heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disorder of the haemostasis system and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • Severe uncontrolled hypertension and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • Severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">During the treatment, patients are carefully monitored with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though in PCI-patients with bivalirudine most haemorrhages occur in arterial punctures, patients who undergo a percutaneous corona intervention (PCI) can perform bleeding during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with bivalira, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regulated Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after discontinuation of treatment with bivalirudine is again achieved prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolysis or thrombocyte aggregationshemmer), these active ingredients may increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudine with thrombocyte aggregationshembers or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are to be monitored regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are inadequate in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestioning Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the bivalira group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, it was more common in women as well as patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding such as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and heavy hemorrhages were significantly less frequent than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point of point, radiological or surgical intervention ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known bleeding point, reduction of the hemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known hemorrhage, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding-localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point-points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudine in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalira group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women as well as patients over 65 years of age were more frequent in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and heavy hemorrhages were significantly less frequent than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system categories in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalirudine is immediately canceled and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudine, a direct and specific thrombocyte inhibitor which binds both the catalytic centre and the anion belt region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is bound in liquid phase or clotting.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudine to thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin, on its part, slowly divides the binding of bivalirudine-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudine was unable to induce thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, bivalirudine displays a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is evidenced by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI has been performed in the patient below, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg bivalira should be given and the infusion can be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, fractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomisation) or in the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugars) in the blood or not effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lucsin differs very slightly from the acting insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot operate insulin effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was reduced compared to a 0.14% decrease in insulin lispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after 6 months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lucsin or any of the other components, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may have to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the abdominal wall, thighs or deltoid muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the abdomen area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active ingredient, the brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the amount of insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dose or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that increase the blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycaemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, discopyects, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphene, spermatylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, sympathies such as beta-blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine can be alleviated or missing the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin relating to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lucsin occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The results reported from clinical studies are listed, grouped according to system categories and ordered after decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive sweating, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is neglected to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a suitably trained person, or by intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Following a glucoagonal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin lucsin occurs faster and the duration of active insulin is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mellit- tus, insulin lucsin showed a dose-proportional glucosescing effect of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionately increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lucsin has a twice as fast effect as normal Human insulin and achieves the full glucose-healing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin lucsin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-prandiale glycaemic control is achieved like with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lucsin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-diaphragm control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lucsin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved like with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- nudes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lucsin administered 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lucsin administered 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
